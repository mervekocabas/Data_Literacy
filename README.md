Corporate involvement in computer vision research has grown significantly in recent years, raising questions about its influence on the field. This study analyzes corporate-affiliated papers in top-tier computer vision conferences, including CVPR, ICCV, and WACV, to assess trends in publication volume,  impact and research focus. While academia still dominates in terms of total publications, our findings reveal a consistent increase in corporate-affiliated papers, with industry participation reaching its highest levels to date. Citation analysis using the Mannâ€“Whitney U test indicates that corporate-affiliated papers receive significantly higher citation counts on average. Corporate research is highly concentrated among a small number of large technology firms, this imbalance raises concerns about the long-term trajectory of computer vision research and the extent to which corporate priorities shape the field. A breakdown of research areas shows that while both academia and industry prioritize Core Vision Algorithms, corporate research is more prevalent in applied domains such as Autonomous Vehicles, AR/VR, Video Analysis, and Natural Language Processing, whereas academia focuses more on Mathematical Foundations and Tools and Frameworks. Our study underscores the need for stronger academic-industry collaborations, open-access initiatives, and shared research resources to ensure a balanced and diverse research landscape.
