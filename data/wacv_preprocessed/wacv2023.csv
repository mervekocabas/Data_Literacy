360MVSNet: Deep Multi-View Stereo Network With 360deg Images for Indoor Scene Reconstruction,"Ching-Ya Chiu, Yu-Ting Wu, I-Chao Shen, Yung-Yu Chuang",The University of Tokyo; National Taiwan University; National Taipei University,100,"Japan, Taiwan",0,,"Recent multi-view stereo methods have achieved promising results with the advancement of deep learning techniques. Despite of the progress, due to the limited fields of view of regular images, reconstructing large indoor environments still requires collecting many images with sufficient visual overlap, which is quite labor-intensive. 360deg images cover a much larger field of view than regular images and would facilitate the capture process. In this paper, we present 360MVSNet, the first deep learning network for multi-view stereo with 360deg images. Our method combines uncertainty estimation with a spherical sweeping module for 360deg images captured from multiple viewpoints in order to construct multi-scale cost volumes. By regressing volumes in a coarse-to-fine manner, high-resolution depth maps can be obtained. Furthermore, we have constructed EQMVS, a large-scale synthetic dataset that consists of over 50K pairs of RGB and depth maps in equirectangular projection. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can reconstruct large synthetic and real-world indoor scenes with significantly better completeness than previous traditional and learning-based methods while saving both time and effort in the data acquisition process.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2023/html/Chiu_360MVSNet_Deep_Multi-View_Stereo_Network_With_360deg_Images_for_Indoor_WACV_2023_paper.html,,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2023/papers/Chiu_360MVSNet_Deep_Multi-View_Stereo_Network_With_360deg_Images_for_Indoor_WACV_2023_paper.pdf,,,,main,Poster,,,,,,
3D Change Localization and Captioning From Dynamic Scans of Indoor Scenes,"Yue Qiu, Shintaro Yamamoto, Ryosuke Yamada, Ryota Suzuki, Hirokatsu Kataoka, Kenji Iwata, Yutaka Satoh",National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST),100,Japan,0,,"Daily indoor scenes often involve constant changes due to human activities.

3D GAN Inversion With Pose Optimization,"Jaehoon Ko, Kyusun Cho, Daewon Choi, Kwangrok Ryoo, Seungryong Kim","Korea University, South Korea",100,South Korea,0,,"With the recent advances in NeRF-based 3D aware GANs quality, projecting an image into the latent space of these 3D-aware GANs has a natural advantage over 2D GAN inversion: not only does it allow multi-view consistent editing of the projected image, but it also enables 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis when given only a single image.

A Neural Video Codec With Spatial Rate-Distortion Control,"Noor Fathima, Jens Petersen, Guillaume Sauti√®re, Auke Wiggers, Reza Pourreza",Qualcomm AI Research,0,,100,USA,"Neural video compression algorithms are nearly competitive with hand-crafted codecs in terms of rate-distortion performance and subjective quality. However, many neural codecs are inflexible black boxes, and give users little to no control over the reconstruction quality and bitrate. In this work, we present a flexible neural video codec that combines ideas from variable-bitrate codecs and region-of-interest-based coding.

A Quality Aware Sample-to-Sample Comparison for Face Recognition,"Mohammad Saeed Ebrahimi Saadabadi, Sahar Rahimi Malakshan, Ali Zafari, Moktari Mostofa, Nasser M. Nasrabadi",West Virginia University,100,USA,0,,"Currently available face datasets mainly consist of a large number of high-quality and a small number of low-quality samples. As a result, a Face Recognition (FR) network fails to learn the distribution of low-quality samples since they are less frequent during training (underrepresented). Moreover, current state-of-the-art FR training paradigms are based on the sample-to-center comparison (i.e., Softmax-based classifier), which results in a lack of uniformity between train and test metrics. This work integrates a quality-aware learning process at the sample level into the classification training paradigm (QAFace). In this regard, Softmax centers are adaptively guided to pay more attention to low-quality samples by using a quality-aware function. Accordingly, QAFace adds a quality-based adjustment to the updating procedure of the Softmax-based classifier to improve the performance on the underrepresented low-quality samples. Our method adaptively finds and assigns more attention to the recognizable low-quality samples in the training datasets. In addition, QAFace ignores the unrecognizable low-quality samples using the feature magnitude as a proxy for quality. As a result, QAFace prevents class centers from getting distracted from the optimal direction. The proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art algorithms in extensive experimental results on the CFP-FP, LFW, CPLFW, CALFW, AgeDB, IJB-B, and IJB-C datasets.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2023/html/Saadabadi_A_Quality_Aware_Sample-to-Sample_Comparison_for_Face_Recognition_WACV_2023_paper.html,,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2023/papers/Saadabadi_A_Quality_Aware_Sample-to-Sample_Comparison_for_Face_Recognition_WACV_2023_paper.pdf,,,2306.04,main,Poster,,,,,,

In this paper, we explore a simple and effective pipeline to build a strong one-stage spatial-temporal action detector. The pipeline is composed by two parts: one is a simple end-to-end spatial-temporal action detector. The proposed end-to-end detector has minor architecture changes to current proposal-based detectors and does not add extra action classification modules. The other part is a novel labeling strategy to utilize unlabeled frames in sparse annotated data. We named our model as SE-STAD.

Atmospheric turbulence causes significant degradation to image quality by introducing blur and geometric distortion. In recent years, various deep learning-based single image atmospheric turbulence mitigation methods, including CNN-based and GAN inversion-based, have been proposed in the literature which attempt to remove the distortion in the image. However, some of these methods are difficult to train and often fail to reconstruct facial features and produce unrealistic results, especially in the case of high turbulence. Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have recently gained some traction because of their stable training process and their ability to generate high quality images.

ATCON: Attention Consistency for Vision Models,"Ali Mirzazadeh, Florian Dubost, Maxwell Pike, Krish Maniar, Max Zuo, Christopher Lee-Messer, Daniel Rubin","Georgia Institute of Technology; Stanford University; Stanford University, Georgia Institute of Technology",100,USA,0,,"Attention--or attribution--maps methods are methods designed to highlight regions of the model's input that were discriminative for its predictions.

This indicates that either the model learned incorrect representations or that the attention maps methods did not accurately estimate the model's representations.

An Embedding-Dynamic Approach to Self-Supervised Learning,"Suhong Moon, Domas Buracas, Seunghyun Park, Jinkyu Kim, John Canny","Clova AI Research, NAVER Corp; UC Berkeley; Korea University",66.66666667,"South Korea, USA",33.33333333,South Korea,"A number of recent self-supervised learning methods have shown impressive performance on image classification and other tasks. A somewhat bewildering variety of techniques have been used, not always with a clear understanding of the reasons for their benefits, especially when used in combination. Here we treat the embeddings of images as point particles and consider model optimization as a dynamic process on this system of particles. Our dynamic model combines an attractive force for similar images, a locally dispersive force to avoid local collapse, and a global dispersive force to achieve a globally-homogeneous distribution of particles. The dynamic perspective highlights the advantage of using a delayed-parameter image embedding (a la BYOL) together with multiple views of the same image. It also uses a purely-dynamic local dispersive force (Brownian motion) that shows improved performance over other methods and does not require knowledge of other particle coordinates. The method is called MSBReg which stands for (i) a Multiview centroid loss, which applies an attractive force to pull different image view embeddings toward their centroid, (ii) a Singular value loss, which pushes the particle system toward spatially homogeneous density, (iii) a Brownian diffusive loss.

A somewhat bewildering variety of techniques have been used, not always with a clear understanding of the reasons for their benefits, especially when used in combination. Here we treat the embeddings of images as point particles and consider model optimization as a dynamic process on this system of particles. Our dynamic model combines an attractive force for similar images, a locally dispersive force to avoid local collapse, and a global dispersive force to achieve a globally-homogeneous distribution of particles. The dynamic perspective highlights the advantage of using a delayed-parameter image embedding (a la BYOL) together with multiple views of the same image. It also uses a purely-dynamic local dispersive force (Brownian motion) that shows improved performance over other methods and does not require knowledge of other particle coordinates. The method is called MSBReg which stands for (i) a Multiview centroid loss, which applies an attractive force to pull different image view embeddings toward their centroid, (ii) a Singular value loss, which pushes the particle system toward spatially homogeneous density, (iii) a Brownian diffusive loss. We evaluate downstream classification performance of MSBReg on ImageNet as well as transfer learning tasks including fine-grained classification, multi-class object classification, object detection, and instance segmentation. In addition, we also show that applying our regularization term to other methods further improves their performance and stabilize the training by preventing a mode collapse."

Arbitrary Style Guidance for Enhanced Diffusion-Based Text-to-Image Generation,"Zhihong Pan, Xin Zhou, Hao Tian",Baidu Research (USA),0,,100,USA,"Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models like GLIDE and DALLE-2 have gained wide success recently for their superior performance in turning complex text inputs into images of high quality and wide diversity. In particular, they are proven to be very powerful in creating graphic arts of various formats and styles. Although current models supported specifying style formats like oil painting or pencil drawing, fine-grained style features like color distributions and brush strokes are hard to specify as they are randomly picked from a conditional distribution based on the given text input. Here we propose a novel style guidance method to support generating images using arbitrary style guided by a reference image.

Avoiding Lingering in Learning Active Recognition by Adversarial Disturbance,"Lei Fan, Ying Wu",Northwestern University,100,USA,0,,"This paper considers the active recognition scenario, where the agent is empowered to intelligently acquire observations for better recognition.

However, this joint learning process could lead to unintended solutions, like a collapsed policy that only visits views that the recognizer is already sufficiently trained to obtain rewards, which harms the generalization ability. We call this phenomenon lingering to depict the agent being reluctant to explore challenging views during training.

"BURST: A Benchmark for Unifying Object Recognition, Segmentation and Tracking in Video","Ali Athar, Jonathon Luiten, Paul Voigtlaender, Tarasha Khurana, Achal Dave, Bastian Leibe, Deva Ramanan","Amazon; Carnegie Mellon University, USA; Google; RWTH Aachen University, Germany",50,"Germany, USA",50,USA,"Multiple existing benchmarks involve tracking and segmenting objects in video e.g., Video Object Segmentation (VOS) and Multi-Object Tracking and Segmentation (MOTS), but there is little interaction between them due to the use of disparate benchmark datasets and metrics (e.g. \JnF, mAP, sMOTSA). As a result, published works usually target a particular benchmark, and are not easily comparable to each another. We believe that the development of generalized methods that can tackle multiple tasks requires greater cohesion among these research sub-communities. In this paper, we aim to facilitate this by proposing BURST, a dataset which contains thousands of diverse videos with high-quality object masks, and an associated benchmark with six tasks involving object tracking and segmentation in video.

Body Part-Based Representation Learning for Occluded Person Re-Identification,"Vladimir Somers, Christophe De Vleeschouwer, Alexandre Alahi","EPFL & UCLouvain & Sportradar; EPFL, Switzerland; UCLouvain, Belgium",100,"Belgium, Switzerland",0,,"Occluded person re-identification (ReID) is a person retrieval task which aims at matching occluded person images with holistic ones. For addressing occluded ReID, part-based methods have been shown beneficial as they offer fine-grained information and are well suited to represent partially visible human bodies. However, training a part-based model is a challenging task for two reasons. Firstly, individual body part appearance is not as discriminative as global appearance (two distinct IDs might have the same local appearance), this means standard ReID training objectives using identity labels are not adapted to local feature learning. Secondly, ReID datasets are not provided with human topographical annotations. In this work, we propose BPBreID, a body part-based ReID model for solving the above issues. We first design two modules for predicting body part attention maps and producing body part-based features of the ReID target.

For addressing occluded ReID, part-based methods have been shown beneficial as they offer fine-grained information and are well suited to represent partially visible human bodies. However, training a part-based model is a challenging task for two reasons. Firstly, individual body part appearance is not as discriminative as global appearance (two distinct IDs might have the same local appearance), this means standard ReID training objectives using identity labels are not adapted to local feature learning. Secondly, ReID datasets are not provided with human topographical annotations. In this work, we propose BPBreID, a body part-based ReID model for solving the above issues. We first design two modules for predicting body part attention maps and producing body part-based features of the ReID target.

We also show that scaling to even seven times the training data, or using non-human-saliency auxiliary information, such as segmentation masks, and standard loss cannot beat the performance of CYBORG-trained models. As a side effect of this work, we observe that the addition of explicit region annotation to the task of synthetic face detection increased human classification accuracy. This work opens a new area of research on how to incorporate human visual saliency into loss functions in practice. All data, code and trained models used in this work are offered with this paper."

In this scenario, the ReID model must adapt to a complex target domain defined by a network of diverse video cameras based on tracklet information. State-of-art methods cluster unlabeled target data, yet domain shifts across target cameras (sub-domains) can lead to poor initialization of clustering methods that propagates noise across epochs, and the ReID model cannot accurately associate samples of the same identity.

To address this problem, we present CameraPose, a weakly-supervised framework for 3D human pose estimation from a single image, which can not only be applied on 2D-3D pose pairs but also on 2D alone annotations. By adding a camera parameter branch, any in-the-wild 2D annotations can be fed into our pipeline to boost the training diversity and the 3D poses can be implicitly learned by reprojecting back to 2D. Moreover, CameraPose introduces a refinement network module with confidence-guided loss to further improve the quality of noisy 2D keypoints extracted by 2D pose estimators. Experimental results demonstrate that the CameraPose brings in clear improvements on cross-scenario datasets. Notably, it outperforms the baseline method by 3mm on the most challenging dataset 3DPW.

To address this problem, we practically demonstrate that unlabeled data class-level confidence can represent the learning status in the 3D imbalanced dataset. Based on this finding, we present a novel class-level confidence based 3D SSL method. Firstly, a dynamic thresholding strategy is proposed to utilize more unlabeled data, especially for low learning status classes. Then, a re-sampling strategy is designed to avoid biasing toward high learning status classes, which dynamically changes the sampling probability of each class. To show the effectiveness of our method in 3D SSL tasks, we conduct extensive experiments on 3D SSL classification and detection tasks. Our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art counterparts for both 3D SSL classification and detection tasks in all datasets."

CoKe: Contrastive Learning for Robust Keypoint Detection,"Yutong Bai, Angtian Wang, Adam Kortylewski, Alan Yuille",University of Freiburg; Max-Planck-Institute for Informatics; Johns Hopkins University,100,"Germany, USA",0,,"In this paper, we introduce a contrastive learning framework for keypoint detection (CoKe).

Complementary Bi-Directional Feature Compression for Indoor 360deg Semantic Segmentation With Self-Distillation,"Zishuo Zheng, Chunyu Lin, Lang Nie, Kang Liao, Zhijie Shen, Yao Zhao","Institute of Information Science, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China",100,China,0,,"Semantic segmentation on 360deg images is a vital component of scene understanding due to the rich surrounding information. Recently, horizontal representation-based approaches outperform projection-based solutions, because the distortions can be effectively removed by compressing the spherical data in the vertical direction. However, these methods ignore the distortion distribution prior and are limited to unbalanced receptive fields, e.g., the receptive fields are sufficient in the vertical direction and insufficient in the horizontal direction. Differently, a vertical representation compressed in another direction can offer implicit distortion prior and enlarge horizontal receptive fields. In this paper, we combine the two different representations and propose a novel 360deg semantic segmentation solution from a complementary perspective. Our network comprises three modules: a feature extraction module, a bi-directional compression module, and an ensemble decoding module. First, we extract multi-scale features from a panorama. Then, a bi-directional compression module is designed to compress features into two complementary low-dimensional representations, which provide content perception and distortion prior. Furthermore, to facilitate the fusion of bi-directional features, we design a unique self distillation strategy in the ensemble decoding module to enhance the interaction of different features and further improve the performance.

Composite Learning for Robust and Effective Dense Predictions,"Menelaos Kanakis, Thomas E. Huang, David Br√ºggemann, Fisher Yu, Luc Van Gool","ETH Z√ºrich; ETH Z√ºrich, KU Leuven",100,"Belgium, Switzerland",0,,"Multi-task learning promises better model generalization on a target task by jointly optimizing it with an auxiliary task. However, the current practice requires additional labeling efforts for the auxiliary task, while not guaranteeing better model performance. In this paper, we find that jointly training a dense prediction (target) task with a self-supervised (auxiliary) task can consistently improve the performance of the target task, while eliminating the need for labeling auxiliary tasks. We refer to this joint training as Composite Learning (CompL). Experiments of CompL on monocular depth estimation, semantic segmentation, and boundary detection show consistent performance improvements in fully and partially labeled datasets.

Composite Relationship Fields With Transformers for Scene Graph Generation,"George Adaimi, David Mizrahi, Alexandre Alahi","EPFL, VITA",100,Switzerland,0,,"Scene graph generation (SGG) methods extract relationships between objects.

Context-Empowered Visual Attention Prediction in Pedestrian Scenarios,"Igor Vozniak, Philipp M√ºller, Lorena Hell, Nils Lipp, Ahmed Abouelazm, Christian M√ºller",German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI),0,,100,Germany,"Effective and flexible allocation of visual attention is key for pedestrians who have to navigate to a desired goal under different conditions of urgency and safety preferences. While automatic modelling of pedestrian attention holds great promise to improve simulations of pedestrian behavior, current saliency prediction approaches mostly focus on generic free-viewing scenarios and do not reflect the specific challenges present in pedestrian attention prediction. In this paper, we present Context-SalNET, a novel encoder-decoder architecture that explicitly addresses three key challenges of visual attention prediction in pedestrians: First, Context-SalNET explicitly models the context factors urgency and safety preference in the latent space of the encoder-decoder model. Second, we propose the exponentially weighted mean squared error loss (ew-MSE) that is able to better cope with the fact that only a small part of the ground truth saliency maps consist of non-zero entries. Third, we explicitly model epistemic uncertainty to account for the fact that training data for pedestrian attention prediction is limited.

In this paper, we present Context-SalNET, a novel encoder-decoder architecture that explicitly addresses three key challenges of visual attention prediction in pedestrians: First, Context-SalNET explicitly models the context factors urgency and safety preference in the latent space of the encoder-decoder model. Second, we propose the exponentially weighted mean squared error loss (ew-MSE) that is able to better cope with the fact that only a small part of the ground truth saliency maps consist of non-zero entries. Third, we explicitly model epistemic uncertainty to account for the fact that training data for pedestrian attention prediction is limited.

Our results show that regression-based 3D counting methods systematically outperform detection-based methods, and reveal that directly learning from raw point clouds greatly assists count estimation under extreme occlusion.

This oftentimes leads to substandard object detection and localization at inference time. To tackle this issue, we propose D2DF2WOD, a Dual-Domain Fully-to-Weakly Supervised Object Detection framework that leverages synthetic data, annotated with precise object localization, to supplement a natural image target domain, where only image-level labels are available. In its warm-up domain adaptation stage, the model learns a fully-supervised object detector (FSOD) to improve the precision of the object proposals in the target domain, and at the same time learns target-domain-specific and detection-aware proposal features. In its main WSOD stage, a WSOD model is specifically tuned to the target domain. The feature extractor and the object proposal generator of the WSOD model are built upon the fine-tuned FSOD model. We test D2DF2WOD on five dual-domain image benchmarks.

Understanding decisions made by black-box algorithms is critical, and assessing their fairness and susceptibility to bias is a key step towards healthcare deployment. In this paper, we propose DBCE (Deformation Based Counterfactual Explainability). We optimise a diffeomorphic transformation that deforms a given input image to change the prediction of the model. This provides anatomically meaningful saliency maps indicating tissue atrophy and expansion, which can be easily interpreted by clinicians. In our test case, DBCE replicates the transition of a patient from healthy control (HC) to Alzheimer's disease (AD). We benchmark DBCE against three commonly used saliency methods. We show that it provides more meaningful saliency maps when applied to one subject and disease-consistent atrophy patterns when used over a larger cohort.

DSTrans: Dual-Stream Transformer for Hyperspectral Image Restoration,"Dabing Yu, Qingwu Li, Xiaolin Wang, Zhiliang Zhang, Yixi Qian, Chang Xu",Hohai university,100,China,0,,"Most CNN models exhibit two major flaws in hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration tasks.

In this paper, we customize a novel dual-stream Transformer (DSTrans) for HSI restoration, which mainly consists of the dual-stream attention and the dual-stream feed-forward network. Specifically, we develop the dual-stream attention consisting of Multi-Dconv-head spectral attention (MDSA) and Multi-head Spatial self-attention (MSSA).

Delving Into Masked Autoencoders for Multi-Label Thorax Disease Classification,"Junfei Xiao, Yutong Bai, Alan Yuille, Zongwei Zhou",Johns Hopkins University,100,USA,0,,"Vision Transformer (ViT) has become one of the most popular neural architectures due to its simplicity, scalability, and compelling performance in multiple vision tasks. However, since the scales of medical datasets are relatively small, ViT has shown inferior performance on medical datasets even after pre-trained on ImageNet. In this paper, we unleash the potential of ViT by pre-training on 266,340 unlabeled chest X-rays. Specifically, we explore Masked Autoencoders (MAE) whose task is to reconstruct missing pixels from a small proportion of each image and figure out a strong recipe for pre-training MAE and fine-tuning on chest X-ray datasets, revealing that medical reconstruction needs a much smaller proportion of an image than natural images (10% vs. 25%) and a more moderate RandomResizedCrop cropping range than natural images (0.5 1.0 vs. 0.2 1.0). With our recipe, ViT-S shows competitive results with the state-of-the-art CNN model (DenseNet-121) on three public chest X-ray datasets and 2.5x faster pre-training on the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset and CheXpert. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to make vanilla ViT achieve state-of-the-art performance on chest X-ray datasets.

However, ViT has shown inferior performance to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on medical tasks due to its data-hungry nature and the lack of an-notated medical data. In this paper, we pre-train ViTs on 266,340 chest X-rays using Masked Autoencoders (MAE) which reconstruct missing pixels from a small part of each image. For comparison, CNNs are also pre-trained on the same 266,340 X-rays using advanced self-supervised methods (e.g. MoCo v2). The results show that our pre-trained ViT performs comparably (sometimes better) to the state-of-the-art CNN (DenseNet-121) for multi-label thorax dis-ease classification. This performance is attributed to the strong recipes extracted from our empirical studies for pre-training and fine-tuning ViT. The pre-training recipe signifies that medical reconstruction requires a much smaller proportion of an image (10% vs. 25%) and a more moderate random resized crop range (0.5‚àº1.0 vs. 0.2‚àº1.0) compared with natural imaging. Furthermore, we remark that in-domain transfer learning is preferred whenever possible. The fine-tuning recipe discloses that layer-wise LR decay, RandAug magnitude, and DropPath rate are significant factors to consider. We hope that this study can direct future research on the application of Transformers to a larger variety of medical imaging tasks."

The proposed DCFormer is tested on various downstream tasks including image classification, object detection and instance segmentation, and achieves state-of-the-art comparable performance with less FLOPs, and outperforms the commonly used backbone (e.g. SWIN) at similar FLOPs. Our ablation results also show that the proposed method generalizes well on different transformer backbones."
Dissecting Deep Metric Learning Losses for Image-Text Retrieval,"Hong Xuan, Xi (Stephen) Chen",Microsoft,0,,100,USA,"Visual-Semantic Embedding (VSE) is a prevalent approach in image-text retrieval by learning a joint embedding space between the image and language modalities where semantic similarities would be preserved.

Do Adaptive Active Attacks Pose Greater Risk Than Static Attacks?,"Nathan Drenkow, Max Lennon, I-Jeng Wang, Philippe Burlina",The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,100,USA,0,,"In contrast to perturbation-based attacks, patch-based attacks are physically realizable, and are therefore increasingly studied.

Do Pre-Trained Models Benefit Equally in Continual Learning?,"Kuan-Ying Lee, Yuanyi Zhong, Yu-Xiong Wang",University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,100,USA,0,,"A large part of the continual learning (CL) literature focuses on developing algorithms for models trained from scratch. While these algorithms work great with from-sc ratch trained models on widely used CL benchmarks, they show dramatic performance drops on more complex datasets (e.g., Split-CUB200). Pre-trained models, widely used to transfer knowledge to downstream tasks, could enhance these methods to be applicable in more realistic scenarios. However, surprisingly, improvements in CL algorithms from pre-training are inconsistent. For instance, while Incremental Classifier and Representation Learning (iCaRL) underperforms Supervised Contrastive Replay (SCR) when trained from scratch, it outperforms SCR when both are initialized with a pre-trained model. This indicates the paradigm current CL literature follows, where all methods are compared in from-scratch training, is not well reflective of the true CL objective and desired progress. Furthermore, we found 1) CL algorithms that exert less regularization benefit more from a pre-trained model; 2) a model pre-trained with a larger dataset (WebImageText in Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) vs. ImageNet) does not guarantee a better improvement. Based on these findings, we introduced a simple yet effective baseline that employs minimum regularization and leverages the more beneficial pre-trained model, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods when pre-training is applied.

Despite their encouraging performance on contrived benchmarks, these algorithms show dramatic performance drop in real-world scenarios. Therefore, this paper advocates the systematic introduction of pre-training to CL, which is a general recipe for transferring knowledge to downstream tasks but is substantially missing in the CL community. Our investigation reveals the multifaceted complexity of exploiting pre-trained models for CL, along three different axes: pre-trained models, CL algorithms, and CL scenarios. Perhaps most intriguingly, improvements in CL algorithms from pre-training are very inconsistent ‚Äì an underperforming algorithm could become competitive and even state of the art, when all algorithms start from a pretrained model. This indicates that the current paradigm, where all CL methods are compared in from-scratch training, is not well reflective of the true CL objective and desired progress. In addition, we make several other important observations, including that 1) CL algorithms that exert less regularization benefit more from a pre-trained model; and 2) a stronger pre-trained model such as CLIP does not guarantee a better improvement.

Domain Adaptation Using Self-Training With Mixup for One-Stage Object Detection,"Jitender Maurya, Keyur R.

Another set of methods utilizes Self-Training which relies on pseudo labels to approximate the target domain distribution directly.

Lastly, we demonstrate a further 20.5% increase in mAP by using a novel application of few-shot learning with thirty shots each for the novel PASCALRAW dataset, constituting 3 classes.

Encouraging Disentangled and Convex Representation With Controllable Interpolation Regularization,"Yunhao Ge, Zhi Xu, Yao Xiao, Gan Xin, Yunkui Pang, Laurent Itti","University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA",100,USA,0,,"We focus on controllable disentangled representation learning (C-Dis-RL), where users can control the partition of the disentangled latent space to factorize dataset attributes (concepts) for downstream tasks.

Stone, Shafin Rahman","BDSI, Australian National University, Australia; ECE, North South University, Bangladesh",100,"Australia, Bangladesh",0,,"Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is essential for understanding diseases and developing novel treatments. It measures gene expression of each fine-grained area (i.e., different windows) in the tissue slide with low throughput. This paper proposes an Exemplar Guided Network (EGN) to accurately and efficiently predict gene expression directly from each window of a tissue slide image. We apply exemplar learning to dynamically boost gene expression prediction from nearest/similar exemplars of a given tissue slide image window. Our EGN framework composes of three main components: 1) an extractor to structure a representation space for unsupervised exemplar retrievals; 2) a vision transformer (ViT) backbone to progressively extract representations of the input window; and 3) an Exemplar Bridging (EB) block to adaptively revise the intermediate ViT representations by using the nearest exemplars. Finally, we complete the gene expression prediction task with a simple attention-based prediction block. Experiments on standard benchmark datasets indicate the superiority of our approach when comparing with the past state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2023/html/Yang_Exemplar_Guided_Deep_Neural_Network_for_Spatial_Transcriptomics_Analysis_of_WACV_2023_paper.html,,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2023/papers/Yang_Exemplar_Guided_Deep_Neural_Network_for_Spatial_Transcriptomics_Analysis_of_WACV_2023_paper.pdf,,,2210.16721,main,Poster,,,,,,

FLOAT: Fast Learnable Once-for-All Adversarial Training for Tunable Trade-Off Between Accuracy and Robustness,"Souvik Kundu, Sairam Sundaresan, Massoud Pedram, Peter A. Beerel","Intel Labs, USA; Intel Labs, USA and University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA; University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA",66.66666667,USA,33.33333333,USA,"Existing models that achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both clean and adversarially-perturbed images rely on convolution operations conditioned with feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) layers. These layers require additional parameters and are hyperparameter sensitive. They significantly increase training time, memory cost, and potential latency which can be costly for resource-limited or real-time applications. In this paper, we present a fast learnable once-for-all adversarial training (FLOAT) algorithm, which instead of the existing FiLM-based conditioning, presents a unique weight conditioned learning that requires no additional layer, thereby incurring no significant increase in parameter count, training time, or network latency compared to standard adversarial training. In particular, we add configurable scaled noise to the weight tensors that enables a trade-off between clean and adversarial performance. Extensive experiments show that FLOAT can yield SOTA performance improving both clean and perturbed image classification by up to  6% and  10%, respectively. Moreover, real hardware measurement shows that FLOAT can reduce the training time by up to 1.43x with fewer model parameters of up to 1.47x on iso-hyperparameter settings compared to the FiLM-based alternatives. Additionally, to further improve memory efficiency we introduce FLOAT sparse (FLOATS), a form of non-iterative model pruning, and provide detailed empirical analysis in yielding a three-way accuracy-robustness-complexity trade-off for these new class of pruned conditionally trained models.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2023/html/Kundu_FLOAT_Fast_Learnable_Once-for-All_Adversarial_Training_for_Tunable_Trade-Off_Between_WACV_2023_paper.html,,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2023/papers/Kundu_FLOAT_Fast_Learnable_Once-for-All_Adversarial_Training_for_Tunable_Trade-Off_Between_WACV_2023_paper.pdf,,,,main,Poster,,,,,,

Far3Det is particularly important for autonomous vehicles (AVs) operating at highway speeds, which require detections of far-field obstacles to ensure sufficient braking distances. However, contemporary AV benchmarks such as nuScenes underemphasize this problem because they evaluate performance only up to a certain distance (50m). One reason is that obtaining far-field 3D annotations is difficult, particularly for lidar sensors that produce very few point returns for far-away objects. Indeed, we find that almost 50% of far-field objects (beyond 50m) contain zero lidar points. Secondly, current metrics for 3D detection employ a ""one-size-fits-all"" philosophy, using the same tolerance thresholds for near and far objects, inconsistent with tolerances for both human vision and stereo disparities.

Fast Online Video Super-Resolution With Deformable Attention Pyramid,"Dario Fuoli, Martin Danelljan, Radu Timofte, Luc Van Gool","KU Leuven, Belgium; CAIDAS, University of W√ºrzburg, Germany; Computer Vision Lab, ETH Z√ºrich, Switzerland",100,"Belgium, Germany, Switzerland",0,,"Video super-resolution (VSR) has many applications that pose strict causal, real-time, and latency constraints, including video streaming and TV. We address the VSR problem under these settings, which poses additional important challenges since information from future frames is unavailable. Importantly, designing efficient, yet effective frame alignment and fusion modules remain central problems. In this work, we propose a recurrent VSR architecture based on a deformable attention pyramid (DAP). Our DAP aligns and integrates information from the recurrent state into the current frame prediction. To circumvent the computational cost of traditional attention-based methods, we only attend to a limited number of spatial locations, which are dynamically predicted by the DAP.

Federated Domain Generalization for Image Recognition via Cross-Client Style Transfer,"Junming Chen, Meirui Jiang, Qi Dou, Qifeng Chen",HKUST; CUHK,100,Hong Kong,0,,"Domain generalization (DG) has been a hot topic in image recognition, with a goal to train a general model that can perform well on unseen domains.

In this paper, we propose a novel domain generalization method for image recognition under federated learning through cross-client style transfer (CCST) without exchanging data samples.

To tackle the obstacle, we propose a novel learning block, equipped with a similarity comparison module and a feature enhancement module. Concretely, given a support image and a query image, we first derive a score map by comparing their projected features at every spatial position. The score maps regarding all support images are collected together and normalized across both the exemplar dimension and the spatial dimensions, producing a reliable similarity map. We then enhance the query feature with the support features by employing the developed point-wise similarities as the weighting coefficients. Such a design encourages the model to inspect the query image by focusing more on the regions akin to the support images, leading to much clearer boundaries between different objects.

Fine Gaze Redirection Learning With Gaze Hardness-Aware Transformation,"Sangjin Park, Daeha Kim, Byung Cheol Song","Inha University, Incheon, Republic of Korea",100,South Korea,0,,"The gaze redirection is a task to adjust the gaze of a given face or eye image toward the desired direction and aims to learn the gaze direction of a face image through a neural network-based generator.

Fine-Context Shadow Detection Using Shadow Removal,"Jeya Maria Jose Valanarasu, Vishal M.

FreeREA: Training-Free Evolution-Based Architecture Search,"Niccol√≤ Cavagnero, Luca Robbiano, Barbara Caputo, Giuseppe Averta","Politecnico di Torino, Italy",100,Italy,0,,"In the last decade, most research in Machine Learning contributed to the improvement of existing models, with the aim of increasing the performance of neural networks for the solution of a variety of different tasks. However, such advancements often come at the cost of an increase of model memory and computational requirements. This represents a significant limitation for the deployability of research output in realistic settings, where the cost, the energy consumption, and the complexity of the framework play a crucial role. To solve this issue, the designer should search for models that maximise the performance while limiting its footprint. Typical approaches to reach this goal rely either on manual procedures, which cannot guarantee the optimality of the final design, or upon Neural Architecture Search algorithms to automatise the process, at the expenses of extremely high computational time. This paper provides a solution for the fast identification of a neural network that maximises the model accuracy while preserving size and computational constraints typical of tiny devices.

However, such advancements often come at the cost of an increase of model memory and computational requirements. This represents a significant limitation for the deployability of research output in realistic settings, where the cost, the energy consumption, and the complexity of the framework play a crucial role. To solve this issue, the designer should search for models that maximise the performance while limiting its footprint. Typical approaches to reach this goal rely either on manual procedures, which cannot guarantee the optimality of the final design, or upon Neural Architecture Search algorithms to automatise the process, at the expenses of extremely high computational time. This paper provides a solution for the fast identification of a neural network that maximises the model accuracy while preserving size and computational constraints typical of tiny devices.

GLAD: A Global-to-Local Anomaly Detector,"Aitor Artola, Yannis Kolodziej, Jean-Michel Morel, Thibaud Ehret","Visionairy; Universit¬¥e Paris-Saclay, CNRS, ENS Paris-Saclay, Centre Borelli, France",50,France,50,USA,"Learning to detect automatic anomalies in production plants remains a machine learning challenge. Since anomalies by definition cannot be learned, their detection must rely on a very accurate ""normality model"". To this aim, we introduce here a global-to-local Gaussian model for neural network features, learned from a set of normal images. This probabilistic model enables unsupervised anomaly detection. A global Gaussian mixture model of the features is first learned using all available features from normal data. This global Gaussian mixture model is then localized by an adaptation of the K-MLE algorithm, which learns a spatial weight map for each Gaussian.

Since anomalies by definition cannot be learned, their detection must rely on a very accurate ""normality model"". To this aim, we introduce here a global-to-local Gaussian model for neural network features, learned from a set of normal images. This probabilistic model enables unsupervised anomaly detection. A global Gaussian mixture model of the features is first learned using all available features from normal data. This global Gaussian mixture model is then localized by an adaptation of the K-MLE algorithm, which learns a spatial weight map for each Gaussian. These weights are then used instead of the mixture weights to detect anomalies. This method enables precise modeling of complex data, even with limited data.

GaIA: Graphical Information Gain Based Attention Network for Weakly Supervised Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation,"Min Seok Lee, Seok Woo Yang, Sung Won Han","School of Industrial and Management Engineering, Korea University",100,South Korea,0,,"While point cloud semantic segmentation is a significant task in 3D scene understanding, this task demands a time-consuming process of fully annotating labels.

Gait Recognition Using 3-D Human Body Shape Inference,"Haidong Zhu, Zhaoheng Zheng, Ram Nevatia",University of Southern California,100,USA,0,,"Gait recognition, which identifies individuals based on their walking patterns, is an important biometric technique since it can be observed from a distance and does not require the subject's cooperation.

GliTr: Glimpse Transformers With Spatiotemporal Consistency for Online Action Prediction,"Samrudhdhi B. Rangrej, Kevin J. Liang, Tal Hassner, James J.

However, in applications with constrained resources, an agent may not be able to observe the complete frame, yet must still locate useful glimpses to predict an incomplete action based on local information only. In this paper, we develop Glimpse Transformers (GliTr), which observe only narrow glimpses at all times, thus predicting an ongoing action and the following most informative glimpse location based on the partial spatiotemporal information collected so far. In the absence of a ground truth for the optimal glimpse locations for action recognition, we train GliTr using a novel spatiotemporal consistency objective: We require GliTr to attend to the glimpses with features similar to the corresponding complete frames (i.e. spatial consistency) and the resultant class logits at time t equivalent to the ones predicted using whole frames up to t (i.e. temporal consistency). Inclusion of our proposed consistency objective yields  10% higher accuracy on the Something-Something-v2 (SSv2) dataset than the baseline cross-entropy objective.

In this paper, we develop Glimpse Transformers (GliTr), which observe only narrow glimpses at all times, thus predicting an ongoing action and the following most informative glimpse location based on the partial spatiotemporal information collected so far. In the absence of a ground truth for the optimal glimpse locations for action recognition, we train GliTr using a novel spatiotemporal consistency objective: We require GliTr to attend to the glimpses with features similar to the corresponding complete frames (i.e. spatial consistency) and the resultant class logits at time t equivalent to the ones predicted using whole frames up to t (i.e. temporal consistency). Inclusion of our proposed consistency objective yields ‚àº 10% higher accuracy on the Something-Something-v2 (SSv2) dataset than the baseline cross-entropy objective.

Global-Local Self-Distillation for Visual Representation Learning,"Tim Lebailly, Tinne Tuytelaars",KU Leuven,100,Belgium,0,,"The downstream accuracy of self-supervised methods is tightly linked to the proxy task solved during training and the quality of the gradients extracted from it.

GlobalFlowNet: Video Stabilization Using Deep Distilled Global Motion Estimates,"Jerin Geo James, Devansh Jain, Ajit Rajwade",Indian Institute of Technology Bombay,100,India,0,,"Videos shot by laymen using hand-held cameras contain undesirable shaky motion. Estimating the global motion between successive frames, in a manner not influenced by moving objects, is central to many video stabilization techniques, but poses significant challenges. A large body of work uses 2D affine transformations or homography for the global motion. However, in this work, we introduce a more general representation scheme, which adapts any existing optical flow network to ignore the moving objects and obtain a spatially smooth approximation of the global motion between video frames. We achieve this by a knowledge distillation approach, where we first introduce a low pass filter module into the optical flow network to constrain the predicted optical flow to be spatially smooth. This becomes our student network, named as GLOBALFLOWNET. Then, using the original optical flow network as the teacher network, we train the student network using a robust loss function. Given a trained GLOBALFLOWNET, we stabilize videos using a two stage process. In the first stage, we correct the instability in affine parameters using a quadratic programming approach constrained by a user-specified cropping limit to control loss of field of view. In the second stage, we stabilize the video further by smoothing global motion parameters, expressed using small number of discrete cosine transform coefficients. In extensive experiments on a variety of different videos, our technique outperforms state of the art techniques in terms of subjective quality and different quantitative measures of video stability.

Compared with previous methods, our network can effectively handle the misalignment between the input and the reference without requiring facial priors and learn the aggregated reference set representation in an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, to reconstruct more detailed facial features, we propose a correlation loss that provides a rich representation of the local texture in a controllable spatial range. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework not only has significantly fewer computation cost than recent exemplar-guided methods but also achieves better qualitative and quantitative performance."
HOOT: Heavy Occlusions in Object Tracking Benchmark,"Gozde Sahin, Laurent Itti","University of Southern California, University Park, Los Angeles",100,USA,0,,"In this paper, we present HOOT, the Heavy Occlusions in Object Tracking Benchmark, a new visual object tracking dataset aimed towards handling high occlusion scenarios for single-object tracking tasks.

Harnessing Unrecognizable Faces for Improving Face Recognition,"Siqi Deng, Yuanjun Xiong, Meng Wang, Wei Xia, Stefano Soatto",AWS AI Labs,0,,100,USA,"The common implementation of face recognition systems as a cascade of a detection stage and a recognition or verification stage can cause problems beyond failures of the detector.

High-Resolution Depth Estimation for 360deg Panoramas Through Perspective and Panoramic Depth Images Registration,"Chi-Han Peng, Jiayao Zhang",ByteDance; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University,50,Taiwan,50,China,"We propose a novel approach to compute high-resolution (2048x1024 and higher) depths for panoramas that is significantly faster and qualitatively and qualitatively more accurate than the current state-of-the-art method (360MonoDepth). As traditional neural network-based methods have limitations in the output image sizes (up to 1024x512) due to GPU memory constraints, both 360MonoDepth and our method rely on stitching multiple perspective disparity or depth images to come out a unified panoramic depth map. However, to achieve globally consistent stitching, 360MonoDepth relied on solving extensive disparity map alignment and Poisson-based blending problems, leading to high computation time. Instead, we propose to use an existing panoramic depth map (computed in real-time by any panorama-based method) as the common target for the individual perspective depth maps to register to. This key idea made producing globally consistent stitching results from a straightforward task. Our experiments show that our method generates qualitatively better results than existing panorama-based methods, and further outperforms them quantitatively on datasets unseen by these methods.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2023/html/Peng_High-Resolution_Depth_Estimation_for_360deg_Panoramas_Through_Perspective_and_Panoramic_WACV_2023_paper.html,,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2023/papers/Peng_High-Resolution_Depth_Estimation_for_360deg_Panoramas_Through_Perspective_and_Panoramic_WACV_2023_paper.pdf,,,,main,Poster,,,,,,

Hyperspherical Quantization: Toward Smaller and More Accurate Models,"Dan Liu, Xi Chen, Chen Ma, Xue Liu",,,,,,"Model quantization enables the deployment of deep neural networks under resource-constrained devices. Vector quantization aims at reducing the model size by indexing model weights with full-precision embeddings, i.e., codewords, while the index needs to be restored to 32-bit during computation.

In this paper, we propose an efficient framework for ternary quantization to produce smaller and more accurate compressed models. By integrating hyperspherical learning, pruning and reinitialization, our proposed Hyperspherical Quantization (HQ) method reduces the cosine distance between the full-precision and ternary weights, thus reducing the bias of the straight-through gradient estimator during ternary quantization.

I See-Through You: A Framework for Removing Foreground Occlusion in Both Sparse and Dense Light Field Images,"Jiwan Hur, Jae Young Lee, Jaehyun Choi, Junmo Kim","School of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, South Korea",100,South Korea,0,,"Light field (LF) camera captures rich information from a scene.

Image-Free Domain Generalization via CLIP for 3D Hand Pose Estimation,"Seongyeong Lee, Hansoo Park, Dong Uk Kim, Jihyeon Kim, Muhammadjon Boboev, Seungryul Baek","UNIST, South Korea; UNIST, South Korea and NC Soft, South Korea",100,South Korea,0,,"RGB-based 3D hand pose estimation has been successful for decades thanks to large-scale databases and deep learning. However, the hand pose estimation network does not operate well for hand pose images whose characteristics are far different from the training data. This is caused by various factors such as illuminations, camera angles, diverse backgrounds in the input images, etc. Many existing methods tried to solve it by supplying additional large-scale unconstrained/target domain images to augment data space; however collecting such large-scale images takes a lot of labors. In this paper, we present a simple image-free domain generalization approach for the hand pose estimation framework that uses only source domain data.

However, the hand pose estimation network does not operate well for hand pose images whose characteristics are far different from the training data.

Image-Text Pre-Training for Logo Recognition,"Mark Hubenthal, Suren Kumar",Amazon Inc.,0,,100,USA,"Open-set logo recognition is commonly solved by first detecting possible logo regions and then matching the detected parts against an ever-evolving dataset of cropped logo images.

Improving Diversity With Adversarially Learned Transformations for Domain Generalization,"Tejas Gokhale, Rushil Anirudh, Jayaraman J.

Improving Saliency Models' Predictions of the Next Fixation With Humans' Intrinsic Cost of Gaze Shifts,"Florian Kadner, Tobias Thomas, David Hoppe, Constantin A. Rothkopf","Centre for Cognitive Science & Institute of Psychology, TU Darmstadt",100,Germany,0,,"The human prioritization of image regions can be modeled in a time invariant fashion with saliency maps or sequentially with scanpath models. However, while both types of models have steadily improved on several benchmarks and datasets, there is still a considerable gap in predicting human gaze. Here, we leverage two recent developments to reduce this gap: theoretical analyses establishing a principled framework for predicting the next gaze target and the empirical measurement of the human cost for gaze switches independently of image content. We introduce an algorithm in the framework of sequential decision making, which converts any static saliency map into a sequence of dynamic history-dependent value maps, which are recomputed after each gaze shift.

Here, we leverage two recent developments to reduce this gap: theoretical analyses establishing a principled framework for predicting the next gaze target and the empirical measurement of the human cost for gaze switches independently of image content. We introduce an algorithm in the framework of sequential decision making, which converts any static saliency map into a sequence of dynamic history-dependent value maps, which are recomputed after each gaze shift.

Improving the Robustness of Point Convolution on K-Nearest Neighbor Neighborhoods With a Viewpoint-Invariant Coordinate Transform,"Xingyi Li, Wenxuan Wu, Xiaoli Z. Fern, Li Fuxin","School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University",100,USA,0,,"Recently, there is significant interest in performing convolution over irregularly sampled point clouds.

In order to improve the robustness to different neighborhood samplings, this paper proposes a novel viewpoint-invariant coordinate transform as the input to the weight-generating function for point convolution, in addition to the regular 3D coordinates.

Empirically, we demonstrate that this effectively improves the performance of point cloud convolutions on the SemanticKITTI and ScanNet datasets, as well as the robustness to significant test-time downsampling, which can substantially change the distance of neighbors in a kNN neighborhood.

InDiReCT: Language-Guided Zero-Shot Deep Metric Learning for Images,"Konstantin Kobs, Michael Steininger, Andreas Hotho",University of W√ºrzburg,100,Germany,0,,"Common Deep Metric Learning (DML) datasets specify only one notion of similarity, e.g., two images in the Cars196 dataset are deemed similar if they show the same car model.

Inducing Data Amplification Using Auxiliary Datasets in Adversarial Training,"Saehyung Lee, Hyungyu Lee",,,,,,"Several recent studies have shown that the use of extra in-distribution data can lead to a high level of adversarial robustness.

Its goal is to semantically manipulate parts of an input reference image according to the text descriptions. However, most of the existing works have the following problems: (1) text-irrelevant content cannot always be maintained but randomly changed, (2) the performance of image manipulation still needs to be further improved, (3) only can manipulate descriptive attributes. To solve these problems, we propose a novel image manipulation method that interactively edits an image using complex text instructions. It allows users to not only improve the accuracy of image manipulation but also achieve complex tasks such as enlarging, dwindling, or removing objects and replacing the background with the input image. To make these tasks possible, we apply three strategies. First, the given image is divided into text-relevant content and text-irrelevant content. Only the text-relevant content is manipulated and the text-irrelevant content can be maintained. Second, a super-resolution method is used to enlarge the manipulation region to further improve the operability and to help manipulate the object itself. Third, a user interface is introduced for editing the segmentation map interactively to re-modify the generated image according to the user's desires.

Intra-Batch Supervision for Panoptic Segmentation on High-Resolution Images,"Daan de Geus, Gijs Dubbelman",Eindhoven University of Technology,100,Netherlands,0,,"Unified panoptic segmentation methods are achieving state-of-the-art results on several datasets. To achieve these results on high-resolution datasets, these methods apply crop-based training.

Specifically, it limits the ability of unified networks to discriminate between large object instances, causing them to make predictions that are confused between multiple instances. To solve this, we propose Intra-Batch Supervision (IBS), which improves a network's ability to discriminate between instances by introducing additional supervision using multiple images from the same batch.

Jointly Learning Band Selection and Filter Array Design for Hyperspectral Imaging,"Ke Li, Dengxin Dai, Luc Van Gool","MPI for Informatics; CVL, ETH Zurich; PSI, KU Leuven",100,"Belgium, Germany, Switzerland",0,,"A single-shot multispectral camera equipped with an optimized color filter array (CFA) has the potential to deliver a fast and low-cost hyperspectral (HS) imaging system. Previous solutions are largely restricted to designing demosaicing algorithms for fixed CFAs - be it the Bayer color pattern or evenly-spaced spectral multiplexing patterns. Since sampling and reconstruction are tightly-coupled, the ability to search for an optimal solution is severely constrained by using predefined CFAs. In this work, we simultaneously address the problem of spectral band selection, CFA design, image demosaicing, and spectral image recovery in a joint learning framework for single-shot HS imaging. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based method for spectral band selection and a novel neural network for CFA generation, image demosaicing, and HS image recovery.

SRMs that predict residuals remedy this up to a degree, but fall short of providing an accurate and flexible solution. In this paper, we rethink residual predictions and propose Learnable Residual Attention (LRA) and Learnable Dense Reconstruction Attention (LDRA) modules, which operate over the input and the output of SRMs. These modules guide an SRM to concentrate on shadow region reconstruction, and limit reconstruction of non-shadow regions. The modules improve shadow removal (up to 20%) and detection accuracy across various backbones, and even improve the accuracy of other removal methods (up to 10%). In addition, the modules have minimal overhead (+<1MB memory) and are implemented in a few lines of code. Furthermore, to combat the challenge of training SRMs with small datasets, we present a synthetic dataset generation pipeline. Using our pipeline, we create a dataset called PITSA, which has 10 times more unique shadow-free images than the largest benchmark dataset. Pre-training models on the PITSA significantly improves shadow removal (+2 MAE on shadow regions) and detection accuracy of multiple methods.

In this paper, we rethink residual predictions and propose Learnable Residual Attention (LRA) and Learnable Dense Reconstruction Attention (LDRA) modules, which operate over the input and the output of SRMs. These modules guide an SRM to concentrate on shadow region reconstruction, and limit reconstruction of non-shadow regions. The modules improve shadow removal (up to 20%) and detection accuracy across various backbones, and even improve the accuracy of other removal methods (up to 10%). In addition, the modules have minimal overhead (+<1MB memory) and are implemented in a few lines of code. Furthermore, to combat the challenge of training SRMs with small datasets, we present a synthetic dataset generation pipeline. Using our pipeline, we create a dataset called PITSA, which has 10 times more unique shadow-free images than the largest benchmark dataset. Pre-training models on the PITSA significantly improves shadow removal (+2 MAE on shadow regions) and detection accuracy of multiple methods. Our results show that LRA&LDRA, when plugged into a lightweight architecture pre-trained on the PITSA, outperform state-of-the-art shadow removal (+0.7 all-region MAE) and detection (+0.1 BER) methods on the benchmark ISTD and SRD datasets, despite running faster (+5%) and consuming less memory (√ó150)."

Learning by Hallucinating: Vision-Language Pre-Training With Weak Supervision,"Tzu-Jui Julius Wang, Jorma Laaksonen, Tomas Langer, Heikki Arponen, Tom E. Bishop","Aalto University, Finland; Intuition Machines Inc.; Systematic Alpha*; Glass Imaging*",50,"Finland, USA",50,USA,"Weakly-supervised vision-language (V-L) pre-training (W-VLP) aims at learning cross-modal alignment with little or no paired data, such as aligned images and captions. Recent W-VLP methods, which pair visual features with object tags, help achieve performances comparable with some VLP models trained with aligned pairs in various V-L downstream tasks. This, however, is not the case in cross- modal retrieval (XMR). We argue that the learning of such a W-VLP model is curbed and biased by the object tags of limited semantics. We address the lack of paired V-L data for model supervision with a novel Visual Vocabulary based Feature Hallucinator (WFH), which is trained via weak supervision as a W-VLP model, not requiring images paired with captions. WFH generates visual hallucinations from texts, which are then paired with the originally unpaired texts, allowing more diverse interactions across modalities. Empirically, WFH consistently boosts the prior W-VLP works, e.g. U-VisualBERT (U-VB), over a variety of V-L tasks, i.e. XMR, Visual Question Answering, etc. Notably, benchmarked with recall@ 1,5,10 , it consistently improves U-VB on image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval on two popular datasets Flickr30K and MSCOCO.

Recent W-VLP methods, which pair visual features with object tags, help achieve performances comparable with some VLP models trained with aligned pairs in various V-L downstream tasks. This, however, is not the case in cross-modal retrieval (XMR). We argue that the learning of such a W-VLP model is curbed and biased by the object tags of limited semantics.We address the lack of paired V-L data for model supervision with a novel Visual Vocabulary based Feature Hallucinator (WFH), which is trained via weak supervision as a W-VLP model, not requiring images paired with captions. WFH generates visual hallucinations from texts, which are then paired with the originally unpaired texts, allowing more diverse interactions across modalities.Empirically, WFH consistently boosts the prior W-VLP works, e.g. U-VisualBERT (U-VB), over a variety of V-L tasks, i.e. XMR, Visual Question Answering, etc. Notably, benchmarked with recall@{1,5,10}, it consistently U-VB on image-to-text and improves text-to-image retrieval on two popular datasets Flickr30K and MSCOCO. Meanwhile, it gains by at least 14.5% in cross-dataset generalization tests on these XMR tasks.

Leveraging Off-the-Shelf Diffusion Model for Multi-Attribute Fashion Image Manipulation,"Chaerin Kong, DongHyeon Jeon, Ohjoon Kwon, Nojun Kwak",Seoul National University; NAVER,50,South Korea,50,South Korea,"Fashion attribute editing is a task that aims to convert the semantic attributes of a given fashion image while preserving the irrelevant regions.

LoopDA: Constructing Self-Loops To Adapt Nighttime Semantic Segmentation,"Fengyi Shen, Zador Pataki, Akhil Gurram, Ziyuan Liu, He Wang, Alois Knoll","Technical University of Munich; Peking University; Huawei Munich Research Center; Technical University of Munich, Huawei Munich Research Center; Huawei Munich Research Center, ETH Zurich",80,"China, Germany, Switzerland",20,China,"Due to the lack of training labels and the difficulty of annotating, dealing with adverse driving conditions such as nighttime has posed a huge challenge to the perception system of autonomous vehicles. Therefore, adapting knowledge from a labelled daytime domain to an unlabelled nighttime domain has been widely researched. In addition to labelled daytime datasets, existing nighttime datasets usually provide nighttime images with corresponding daytime reference images captured at nearby locations for reference. The key challenge is to minimize the performance gap between the two domains. In this paper, we propose LoopDA for domain adaptive nighttime semantic segmentation. It consists of self-loops that result in reconstructing the input data using predicted semantic maps, by rendering them into the encoded features. In a warm-up training stage, the self-loops comprise of an inner-loop and an outer-loop, which are responsible for intra-domain refinement and inter-domain alignment, respectively.

Therefore, adapting knowledge from a labelled daytime domain to an unlabelled nighttime domain has been widely researched. In addition to labelled daytime datasets, existing nighttime datasets usually provide nighttime images with corresponding daytime reference images captured at nearby locations for reference. The key challenge is to minimize the performance gap between the two domains. In this paper, we propose LoopDA for domain adaptive nighttime semantic segmentation. It consists of self-loops that result in reconstructing the input data using predicted semantic maps, by rendering them into the encoded features. In a warm-up training stage, the self-loops comprise of an inner-loop and an outer-loop, which are responsible for intra-domain refinement and inter-domain alignment, respectively.

MMPTRACK: Large-Scale Densely Annotated Multi-Camera Multiple People Tracking Benchmark,"Xiaotian Han, Quanzeng You, Chunyu Wang, Zhizheng Zhang, Peng Chu, Houdong Hu, Jiang Wang, Zicheng Liu",Microsoft,0,,100,USA,"Multi-camera tracking systems are gaining popularity in applications that demand high-quality tracking results, such as frictionless checkout. In cluttered and crowded environments, monocular multi-object tracking (MOT) systems often fail due to occlusions. Multiple highly overlapped cameras are capable of recovering partial 3D information. When used properly, 3D data can significantly alleviate the occlusion issue. However, training a multi-camera tracker demands a large-scale multi-camera tracking dataset with diverse camera settings and backgrounds. These requirements make the collection of multi-camera tracking dataset challenging and expensive. The cost of creating such a dataset has limited the availability and scale of datasets in this domain. Instead, we appeal to an auto-annotation system to reduce the cost. The system uses overlapped and calibrated depth and RGB cameras to build a 3D tracker and automatically generates the 3D tracking results. We then manually check and correct the 3D tracking results to ensure the label quality, which is much cheaper than solely manual annotation. Next, the 3D tracking results are projected to each calibrated RGB camera view to create 2D tracking results. In this way, we collect and annotate a large-scale densely labeled multi-camera tracking dataset from five different environments. We have conducted extensive experiments using two real-time multi-camera trackers and a person re-identification (ReID) model under different settings. This dataset provides a reliable benchmark for multi-camera, multi-object tracking systems in cluttered and crowded environments.

In cluttered and crowded environments, monocular multi-object tracking (MOT) systems often fail due to occlusions. Multiple highly overlapped cameras are capable of recovering partial 3D information. When used properly, 3D data can significantly alleviate the occlusion issue. However, training a multi-camera tracker demands a large-scale multi-camera tracking dataset with diverse camera settings and backgrounds. These requirements make the collection of multi-camera tracking dataset challenging and expensive. The cost of creating such a dataset has limited the availability and scale of datasets in this domain. Instead, we appeal to an auto-annotation system to reduce the cost, which uses overlapped and calibrated depth and RGB cameras to build a 3D tracker and automatically generates the 3D tracking results. The results are manually checked and corrected to ensure the label quality, which is much cheaper than solely manual annotation. Next, the 3D tracking results are projected to each calibrated RGB camera view to create 2D tracking results. In this way, we collect and annotate a large-scale densely labeled multi-camera tracking dataset from five different environments. We have conducted extensive experiments using two real-time multi-camera trackers and a person re-identification (ReID) model under different settings. This dataset provides a reliable benchmark for multi-camera, multi-object tracking systems in cluttered and crowded environments.

MRI Imputation Based on Fused Index- and Intensity-Registration,"Jiyoon Shin, Jungwoo Lee","Seoul National University, HodooAI Lab; Seoul National University",100,South Korea,0,,"3D MRI imaging is based on a number of imaging sequences such as T1, T2, T1ce, and Flair, and each of them is performed by a group of two-dimensional scans.

MT-DETR: Robust End-to-End Multimodal Detection With Confidence Fusion,"Shih-Yun Chu, Ming-Sui Lee",National Taiwan University,100,Taiwan,0,,"Due to the trending need for autonomous driving, camera-based object detection has recently attracted lots of attention and successful development.

Medical Image Segmentation via Cascaded Attention Decoding,"Md Mostafijur Rahman, Radu Marculescu",The University of Texas at Austin,100,USA,0,,"Transformers have shown great promise in medical image segmentation due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies through self-attention. However, they lack the ability to learn the local (contextual) relations among pixels. Previous works try to overcome this problem by embedding convolutional layers either in the encoder or decoder modules of transformers thus ending up sometimes with inconsistent features. To address this issue, we propose a novel attention-based decoder, namely CASCaded Attention DEcoder (CASCADE), which leverages the multiscale features of hierarchical vision transformers. CASCADE consists of i) an attention gate which fuses features with skip connections and ii) a convolutional attention module that enhances the long-range and local context by suppressing background information.

To address this issue, we propose a novel attention-based decoder, namely CASCaded Attention DEcoder (CASCADE), which leverages the multi-scale features of hierarchical vision transformers. CASCADE consists of i) an attention gate which fuses features with skip connections and ii) a convolutional attention module that enhances the long-range and local context by suppressing background information.

Mixture Outlier Exposure: Towards Out-of-Distribution Detection in Fine-Grained Environments,"Jingyang Zhang, Nathan Inkawhich, Randolph Linderman, Yiran Chen, Hai Li",Air Force Research Laboratory; Duke University,50,USA,50,USA,"Many real-world scenarios in which DNN-based recognition systems are deployed have inherently fine-grained attributes (e.g., bird-species recognition, medical image classification).

Given the nature of the deployment environment, one may expect such OOD inputs to also be fine-grained w.r.t. the known classes (e.g., a novel bird species), which are thus extremely difficult to identify.

Modality Mixer for Multi-Modal Action Recognition,"Sumin Lee, Sangmin Woo, Yeonju Park, Muhammad Adi Nugroho, Changick Kim",KAIST,100,South Korea,0,,"In multi-modal action recognition, it is important to consider not only the complementary nature of different modalities but also global action content. In this paper, we propose a novel network, named Modality Mixer (M-Mixer) network, to leverage complementary information across modalities and temporal context of an action for multi-modal action recognition. We also introduce a simple yet effective recurrent unit, called Multi-modal Contextualization Unit (MCU), which is a core component of M-Mixer. Our MCU temporally encodes a sequence of one modality (e.g., RGB) with action content features of other modalities (e.g., depth, IR).

We also show that this simple self-supervised approach learns motion features without any explicit motion-specific pretext task. Our results can be reproduced on $github$."

Multi-Frame Attention With Feature-Level Warping for Drone Crowd Tracking,"Takanori Asanomi, Kazuya Nishimura, Ryoma Bise","Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan",100,Japan,0,,"Drone crowd tracking has various applications such as crowd management and video surveillance.

It is necessary as it allows the design of more human-like machines. While transformer approaches have shown great improvements, they face multiple challenges such as lack of data or background noise. To tackle these, we introduce the Forced Attention (FAt) Transformer which utilize forced attention with a modified backbone for input encoding and a use of additional inputs. In addition to improving the performance on different tasks and inputs, the modification requires less time and memory resources. We provide a model for a generalised feature extraction for tasks concerning social signals and behavior analysis.

No Shifted Augmentations (NSA): Compact Distributions for Robust Self-Supervised Anomaly Detection,"Mohamed Yousef, Marcel Ackermann, Unmesh Kurup, Tom Bishop","Intuition Machines, Inc.; Glass Imaging, Inc.",50,USA,50,USA,"Unsupervised Anomaly detection (AD) requires building a notion of normalcy, distinguishing in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data, using only available ID samples. Recently, large gains were made on this task for the domain of natural images using self-supervised contrastive feature learning as a first step followed by kNN or traditional one-class classifiers for feature scoring. Learned representations that are non-uniformly distributed on the unit hypersphere have been shown to be beneficial for this task. We go a step further and investigate how the ph  geometrical compactness  of the ID feature distribution makes isolating and detecting outliers easier, especially in the realistic situation when ID training data is polluted with OOD data. We propose novel architectural modifications to the self-supervised feature learning step, that enable such compact distributions for ID data to be learned. We show that the proposed modifications can be effectively applied to most existing self-supervised objectives, with large gains in performance. Furthermore, this improved OOD performance is obtained without resorting to tricks such as using strongly augmented ID images (e.g. by 90 degree rotations) as proxies for the unseen OOD data, as these impose overly prescriptive assumptions about ID data and its invariances. We perform extensive studies on benchmark datasets for one-class OOD detection and show state-of-the-art performance in the presence of pollution in the ID data, and comparable performance otherwise.

One-Shot Synthesis of Images and Segmentation Masks,"Vadim Sushko, Dan Zhang, J√ºrgen Gall, Anna Khoreva","Bosch Center for ArtiÔ¨Åcial Intelligence; University of Bonn; Bosch Center for ArtiÔ¨Åcial Intelligence, University of T√ºbingen",66.66666667,Germany,33.33333333,Germany,"Joint synthesis of images and segmentation masks with generative adversarial networks (GANs) is promising to reduce the effort needed for collecting image data with pixel-wise annotations. However, to learn high-fidelity image-mask synthesis, existing GAN approaches first need a pre-training phase requiring large amounts of image data, which limits their utilization in restricted image domains. In this work, we take a step to reduce this limitation, introducing the task of one-shot image-mask synthesis. We aim to generate diverse images and their segmentation masks given only a single labelled example, and assuming, contrary to previous models, no access to any pre-training data.

Online Adaptive Temporal Memory With Certainty Estimation for Human Trajectory Prediction,"Manh Huynh, Gita Alaghband","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Colorado Denver",100,USA,0,,"Pedestrian trajectory prediction is an essential component of autonomous systems and robot navigation. Recent research has shown promising predictive performance by designing trajectory prediction networks to model a variety of motion-related features. Different from existing works, our focus is on designing a novel online adaptation framework (OATMem) to exploit the temporal similarities among trajectory samples encountered during testing to improve the prediction accuracy of any such models (i.e., predictors) without knowing the details of these predictors. Our framework consists of two novel modules: an augmented temporal observe-target memory network (ATM) and a certainty-based selector (CS). Inspired by the concept of key-value memory networks [16], we design the ATM to learn the temporal information from short-term past frames by encoding the trajectory samples of past pedestrians in form of observe-target (i.e., key-value) during testing. In addition, we propose a certainty-based selector (CS) to enhance the predictive ability of our framework under scenarios where there are large temporal dissimilarities between current pedestrians' movements and those stored in memory. In dynamic scenes, these scenarios commonly occur due to abrupt changes in contexts, such as camera motions, scene contexts, and pedestrians' behaviors. We extensively evaluate our framework in commonly-used datasets for pedestrian trajectory prediction: JAAD [12] and PIE [19] and show that our framework significantly improves the prediction accuracy of state-of-the-art models.

Online Knowledge Distillation for Multi-Task Learning,"Geethu Miriam Jacob, Vishal Agarwal, Bj√∂rn Stenger","Rakuten Institute of Technology, Rakuten Group, Inc.",100,Japan,0,,"Multi-task learning (MTL) has found wide application in computer vision tasks.

PIDS: Joint Point Interaction-Dimension Search for 3D Point Cloud,"Tunhou Zhang, Mingyuan Ma, Feng Yan, Hai Li, Yiran Chen","Department of Computer Science, University of Houston, Houston, TX 77204; ECE Department, Duke University, Durham, NC 27708",100,USA,0,,"The interaction and dimension of points are two important axes in designing point operators to serve hierarchical 3D models. Yet, these two axes are heterogeneous and challenging to fully explore. Existing works craft point operator under a single axis and reuse the crafted operator in all parts of 3D models. This overlooks the opportunity to better combine point interactions and dimensions by exploiting varying geometry/density of 3D point clouds. In this work, we establish PIDS, a novel paradigm to jointly explore point interactions and point dimensions to serve semantic segmentation on point cloud data. We establish a large search space to jointly consider versatile point interactions and point dimensions. This supports point operators with various geometry/density considerations.

Performer: A Novel PPG-to-ECG Reconstruction Transformer for a Digital Biomarker of Cardiovascular Disease Detection,Ella Lan,"The Harker School, 500 Saratoga Ave, San Jose, CA 95129",100,USA,0,,"Electrocardiography (ECG), an electrical measurement which captures cardiac activities, is the gold standard for diagnosing cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, ECG is infeasible for continuous cardiac monitoring due to its requirement for user participation. By contrast, photoplethysmography (PPG) provides easy-to-collect data, but its limited accuracy constrains its clinical usage. To combine the advantages of both signals, recent studies incorporate various deep learning techniques for the reconstruction of PPG signals to ECG; however, the lack of contextual information as well as the limited abilities to denoise biomedical signals ultimately constrain model performance. In this research, we propose Performer, a novel Transformer-based architecture that reconstructs ECG from PPG and combines the PPG and reconstructed ECG as multiple modalities for CVD detection. This method is the first time that Transformer sequence-to-sequence translation has been performed on biomedical waveform reconstruction, combining the advantages of both PPG and ECG. We also create Shifted Patch-based Attention (SPA), an effective method to encode/decode the biomedical waveforms. Through fetching the various sequence lengths and capturing cross-patch connections, SPA maximizes the signal processing for both local features and global contextual representations. The proposed architecture generates a state-of-the-art performance of 0.29 RMSE for the reconstruction of PPG to ECG on the BIDMC database, surpassing prior studies. We also evaluated this model on the MIMIC-III dataset, achieving a 95.9% accuracy in CVD detection, and on the PPG-BP dataset, achieving 75.9% accuracy in related CVD diabetes detection, indicating its generalizability. As a proof of concept, an earring wearable named PEARL (prototype), was designed to scale up the point-of-care (POC) healthcare system.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2023/html/Lan_Performer_A_Novel_PPG-to-ECG_Reconstruction_Transformer_for_a_Digital_Biomarker_WACV_2023_paper.html,,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2023/papers/Lan_Performer_A_Novel_PPG-to-ECG_Reconstruction_Transformer_for_a_Digital_Biomarker_WACV_2023_paper.pdf,,,2204.11795,main,Poster,,,,,,

These artifacts could be easily obscured due to various distortions (e.g. blurring) and could also be removed with the development of advanced Deepfake techniques, rendering the artifacts-based detection methods less effective in achieving reliable forgery forensics. In this paper, we propose a novel Deepfake detection method that does not depend on identifying the synthesized artifacts, but resorts to a mechanism of anti-counterfeit labels. Specifically, we design a neural network with an encoder-decoder structure to embed messages as anti-Deepfake labels into the facial identity features. Since the injected label is entangled with the facial identity feature, it will be sensitive to face swap translations (i.e., Deepfake), but robust to conventional image modifications (e.g., resize and compress).

Specifically, the self-supervised learning is conducted by exploring the semantic consistency between the videos and text in both coarse-grained and fine-grained fashions, as well as recovering masked frames in the videos. The multimodal framework is trained on a newly-collected dataset that consists of video-text pairs. Additionally, we introduce a progressive video summarization method, where the important content in a video is pinpointed progressively to generate better summaries. Extensive experiments have proved the effectiveness and superiority of our method in rank correlation coefficients and F-score

Real-Time Concealed Weapon Detection on 3D Radar Images for Walk-Through Screening System,"Nagma S.

To ensure accuracy, a weapon needs to be detected irrespective of its 3D orientation, thus we use the 3D radar images as detection input.

In the peak-shaped probability map, the peak marks the weapon's position. So, weapon detection task translates to peak detection on the probability map.

Real-Time Restoration of Dark Stereo Images,"Mohit Lamba, M. V. A.

Addressing this problem can enable night-time capabilities to several applications such as smartphones and self-driving cars. We propose a light-weight and fast hybrid U-net architecture for low-light stereo image enhancement. In the initial few scale spaces, we process the left and right features individually, because the two features do not align well due to large disparity. At coarser scale-spaces, the disparity between left and right features decreases and the network's receptive field increases.

Reconstructing Humpty Dumpty: Multi-Feature Graph Autoencoder for Open Set Action Recognition,"Dawei Du, Ameya Shringi, Anthony Hoogs, Christopher Funk",Kitware,100,USA,0,,"Most action recognition datasets and algorithms assume a closed world, where all test samples are instances of the known classes. In open set problems, test samples may be drawn from either known or unknown classes. Existing open set action recognition methods are typically based on extending closed set methods by adding post hoc analysis of classification scores or feature distances and do not capture the relations among all the video clip elements. Our approach uses the reconstruction error to determine the novelty of the video since unknown classes are harder to put back together and thus have a higher reconstruction error than videos from known classes. We refer to our solution to the open set action recognition problem as ""Humpty Dumpty"", due to its reconstruction abilities. Humpty Dumpty is a novel graph-based autoencoder that accounts for contextual and semantic relations among the clip pieces for improved reconstruction. A larger reconstruction error leads to an increased likelihood that the action can not be reconstructed, i.e., can not put Humpty Dumpty back together again, indicating that the action has never been seen before and is novel/unknown.

Existing open set action recognition methods are typically based on extending closed set methods by adding post hoc analysis of classification scores or feature distances and do not capture the relations among all the video clip elements. Our approach uses the reconstruction error to determine the novelty of the video since unknown classes are harder to put back together and thus have a higher reconstruction error than videos from known classes. We refer to our solution to the open set action recognition problem as ""Humpty Dumpty"", due to its reconstruction abilities. Humpty Dumpty is a novel graph-based autoencoder that accounts for contextual and semantic relations among the clip pieces for improved reconstruction. A larger reconstruction error leads to an increased likelihood that the action can not be reconstructed, i.e., can not put Humpty Dumpty back together again, indicating that the action has never been seen before and is novel/unknown.

Reducing Annotation Effort by Identifying and Labeling Contextually Diverse Classes for Semantic Segmentation Under Domain Shift,"Sharat Agarwal, Saket Anand, Chetan Arora","IIIT Delhi, India; Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, India",100,India,0,,"In Active Domain Adaptation (ADA), one uses Active Learning (AL) to select target domain frames to annotate for Domain Adaptation (DA). Thus, ADA creates a continuum of cost-performance trade-off models, with unsupervised, and fully supervised DA techniques at the two ends. We observe that in ADA not all regions of a selected frame contribute equally to a model's performance, and there is a strong correlation between annotating certain hard/unique/novel object/stuff instances, and a model's performance. E.g., road regions in a target dataset may look mostly similar to source domain except for certain curved instances, where annotation may be more useful. Based on the observation, we propose Anchor-based and Augmentation-based ADA techniques, which, given a selected frame, determine certain 'hard' semantic regions to be annotated in that frame, such that the selected regions are complementary and diverse in the context of the current labeled set. The proposed techniques carefully avoid the pitfall of region based AL techniques which try to choose most uncertain regions in a frame, but ends up selecting all edge pixels, and similar annotation cost as the whole frame. We show that our approach achieves 66.6 \miou on \gta->\cityscapes dataset with a budget of 4.7% in comparison to 64.9 \miou by MADA [??].

Prior art makes use of measures of uncertainty or disagreement of models to identify ‚Äòregions' to be annotated by the human oracle. However, these regions frequently comprise of pixels at object boundaries which are hard and tedious to annotate. Hence, even if the fraction of image pixels annotated reduces, the overall annotation time and the resulting cost still remain high. In this work, we propose an ADA strategy, which given a frame, identifies a set of classes that are hardest for the model to predict accurately, thereby recommending semantically meaningful regions to be annotated in a selected frame. We show that these set of ‚Äòhard' classes are context-dependent and typically vary across frames, and when annotated help the model generalize better.

Rethinking the Data Annotation Process for Multi-View 3D Pose Estimation With Active Learning and Self-Training,"Qi Feng, Kun He, He Wen, Cem Keskin, Yuting Ye",Meta Reality Labs,0,,100,USA,"Pose estimation of the human body and hands is a fundamental problem in computer vision, and learning-based solutions require a large amount of annotated data. In this work, we improve the efficiency of the data annotation process for 3D pose estimation problems with Active Learning (AL) in a multi-view setting. AL selects examples with the highest value to annotate under limited annotation budgets (time and cost), but choosing the selection strategy is often nontrivial. We present a framework to efficiently extend existing single-view AL strategies. We then propose two novel AL strategies that make full use of multi-view geometry. Moreover, we demonstrate additional performance gains by incorporating pseudo-labels computed during the AL process, which is a form of self-training. Our system significantly outperforms simulated annotation baselines in 3D body and hand pose estimation on two large-scale benchmarks: CMU Panoptic Studio and InterHand2.6M. Notably, on CMU Panoptic Studio, we are able to reduce the turn-around time by 60% and annotation cost by 80% when compared to the conventional annotation process.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2023/html/Feng_Rethinking_the_Data_Annotation_Process_for_Multi-View_3D_Pose_Estimation_WACV_2023_paper.html,,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2023/papers/Feng_Rethinking_the_Data_Annotation_Process_for_Multi-View_3D_Pose_Estimation_WACV_2023_paper.pdf,,,,main,Poster,,,,,,

Further, the task assumes that the source data is not available for adaptation, due to privacy concerns or otherwise. We postulate that such systems need to jointly optimize the dual task of (i) selecting fixed number of samples from the target domain for annotation and (ii) transfer of knowledge from the pre-trained network to the target domain. To do this, SALAD consists of a novel Guided Attention Transfer Network (GATN) and an active learning function, HAL. The GATN enables feature distillation from pre-trained network to the target network, complemented with the target samples mined by HAL using transfer-ability and uncertainty criteria. SALAD has three key benefits: (i) it is task-agnostic, and can be applied across various visual tasks such as classification, segmentation and detection; (ii) it can handle shifts in output label space from the pre-trained source network to the target domain; (iii) it does not require access to source data for adaptation. We conduct extensive experiments across 3 visual tasks, viz. digits classification (MNIST, SVHN, VISDA), synthetic (GTA5) to real (CityScapes) image segmentation, and document layout detection (PubLayNet to DSSE). We show that our source-free approach, SALAD, results in an improvement of 0.5%-31.3% (across datasets and tasks) over prior adaptation methods that assume access to large amounts of annotated source data for adaptation.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2023/html/Kothandaraman_SALAD_Source-Free_Active_Label-Agnostic_Domain_Adaptation_for_Classification_Segmentation_and_WACV_2023_paper.html,,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2023/papers/Kothandaraman_SALAD_Source-Free_Active_Label-Agnostic_Domain_Adaptation_for_Classification_Segmentation_and_WACV_2023_paper.pdf,,Available here,2205.1284,main,Poster,,,,,,

SLI-pSp: Injecting Multi-Scale Spatial Layout in pSp,"Aradhya Neeraj Mathur, Anish Madan, Ojaswa Sharma",IIITD,100,India,0,,"We propose SLI-pSp, a general purpose Image-to-Image (I2I) translation model that encodes spatial layout information as well as style in the generator, using pSp as the base architecture. Previous methods like pSp have shown promising results by leveraging StyleGAN as a generator in various I2I tasks but they seem to miss finer or under-represented details in facial images like earrings and caps, and break down on complex datasets due to their solely global approach. To address these shortcomings, we propose a technique termed Spatial Layout Injection (SLI-pSp) that encodes spatial layout information in the input image in the StyleGAN generator along with style.

To alleviate the above issues, we develop a novel ‚ÄòSelect, Label, and Mix‚Äô (SLM) framework that aims to learn discriminative invariant feature representations for partial domain adaptation. First, we present an efficient ""select"" module that automatically filters out the outlier source samples to avoid negative transfer while aligning distributions across both domains. Second, the ""label"" module iteratively trains the classifier using both the labeled source domain data and the generated pseudo-labels for the target domain to enhance the discriminability of the latent space. Finally, the ""mix"" module utilizes domain mixup regularization jointly with the other two modules to explore more intrinsic structures across domains leading to a domain-invariant latent space for partial domain adaptation. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets for partial domain adaptation demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework over state-of-the-art methods.

Self-Supervised Distilled Learning for Multi-Modal Misinformation Identification,"Michael Mu, Sreyasee Das Bhattacharjee, Junsong Yuan","The State University of New York at Buffalo, NY, USA",100,USA,0,,"Rapid dissemination of misinformation is a major societal problem receiving increasing attention. Unlike Deepfake, Out-of-Context misinformation, in which the unaltered unimode contents (e.g. image, text) of a multi-modal news sample are combined in an out-of-context manner to generate deception, requires limited technical expertise to create.

Most existing approaches extract features from its uni-mode counterparts to concatenate and train a model for the misinformation classification task. In this paper, we design a self-supervised feature representation learning strategy that aims to attain the multi-task objectives: (1) task-agnostic, which evaluates the intra- and inter-mode representational consistencies for improved alignments across related models; (2) task-specific, which estimates the category-specific multi-modal knowledge to enable the classifier to derive more discriminative predictive distributions.

Semantic Guided Latent Parts Embedding for Few-Shot Learning,"Fengyuan Yang, Ruiping Wang, Xilin Chen","Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Institute of Computing Technology, CAS, Beijing, 100190, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China; Beijing Academy of ArtiÔ¨Åcial Intelligence, Beijing, 100084, China; Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Institute of Computing Technology, CAS, Beijing, 100190, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China",100,China,0,,"The ability of few-shot learning (FSL) is a basic requirement of intelligent agent learning in the open visual world. However, existing deep learning systems rely too heavily on large numbers of training samples, making it hard to learn new categories efficiently from limited size of training data. Two key challenges of FSL are insufficient comprehension and imperfect modeling of the few-shot novel class. For insufficient visual comprehension, semantic knowledge which is information from other modalities can help replenish the understanding of novel classes. But even so, most works still suffer from the second challenge because the single global class prototype they adopted is extremely unstable and imperfect given the larger intra-class variation and harder inter-class discrimination in FSL scenario. Thus, we propose to represent each class by its several different parts with the help of class semantic knowledge. Since we can never pre-define parts for unknown novel classes, we embed them in a latent manner. Concretely, we train a generator that takes the class semantic knowledge as input and outputs several filters of class-specific semantic latent parts. By applying each part filter, our model can pay attention to corresponding local regions containing each part.

However, existing deep learning systems rely too heavily on large numbers of training samples, making it hard to learn new categories efficiently from limited size of training data. Two key challenges of FSL are insufficient comprehension and imperfect modeling of the few-shot novel class. For insufficient visual comprehension, semantic knowledge which is information from other modalities can help replenish the understanding of novel classes. But even so, most works still suffer from the second challenge because the single global class prototype they adopted is extremely unstable and imperfect given the larger intra-class variation and harder inter-class discrimination in FSL scenario. Thus, we propose to represent each class by its several different parts with the help of class semantic knowledge. Since we can never pre-define parts for unknown novel classes, we embed them in a latent manner. Concretely, we train a generator that takes the class semantic knowledge as input and outputs several filters of class-specific semantic latent parts. By applying each part filter, our model can pay attention to corresponding local regions containing each part. At the inference stage, the classification is conducted by comparing the similarities between those parts. Experiments on several FSL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method and show its potential to go beyond class recognition to class understanding.

Semantic Segmentation With Active Semi-Supervised Learning,"Aneesh Rangnekar, Christopher Kanan, Matthew Hoffman","Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY, USA",100,USA,0,,"Using deep learning, we now have the ability to create exceptionally good semantic segmentation systems; however, collecting the prerequisite pixel-wise annotations for training images remains expensive and time-consuming.

Separating Partially-Polarized Diffuse and Specular Reflection Components Under Unpolarized Light Sources,"Soma Kajiyama, Taihe Piao, Ryo Kawahara, Takahiro Okabe","Department of Artificial Intelligence, Kyushu Institute of Technology, 680-4 Kawazu, Iizuka, Fukuoka 820-8502, Japan",100,Japan,0,,"Separating diffuse and specular reflection components observed on an object surface is important for preprocessing of various computer vision techniques. Conventionally, diffuse-specular separation based on the polarimetric and color clues assumes that the diffuse/specular reflection components are unpolarized/partially polarized under unpolarized light sources.

Seq-UPS: Sequential Uncertainty-Aware Pseudo-Label Selection for Semi-Supervised Text Recognition,"Gaurav Patel, Jan P. Allebach, Qiang Qiu","School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, USA",100,USA,0,,"This paper looks at semi-supervised learning (SSL) for image-based text recognition.

Single-Image HDR Reconstruction by Multi-Exposure Generation,"Phuoc-Hieu Le, Quynh Le, Rang Nguyen, Binh-Son Hua","VinAI Research, University of California San Diego; VinAI Research",50,USA,50,Vietnam,"High dynamic range (HDR) imaging is an indispensable technique in modern photography. Traditional methods focus on HDR reconstruction from multiple images, solving the core problems of image alignment, fusion, and tone mapping, yet having a perfect solution due to ghosting and other visual artifacts in the reconstruction. Recent attempts at single-image HDR reconstruction show a promising alternative: by learning to map pixel values to their irradiance using a neural network, one can bypass the align-and-merge pipeline completely yet still obtain a high-quality HDR image. In this work, we propose a weakly supervised learning method that inverts the physical image formation process for HDR reconstruction via learning to generate multiple exposures from a single image. Our neural network can invert the camera response to reconstruct pixel irradiance before synthesizing multiple exposures and hallucinating details in under- and over-exposed regions from a single input image.

In this work, we propose a weakly supervised learning method that inverts the physical image formation process for HDR reconstruction via learning to generate multiple exposures from a single image.

Split To Learn: Gradient Split for Multi-Task Human Image Analysis,"Weijian Deng, Yumin Suh, Xiang Yu, Masoud Faraki, Liang Zheng, Manmohan Chandraker","NEC Labs America, University of California, San Diego; Australian National University; NEC Labs America",66.66666667,"Australia, USA",33.33333333,Japan,"This paper presents an approach to train a unified deep network that simultaneously solves multiple human-related tasks. A multi-task framework is favorable for sharing information across tasks under restricted computational resources. However, tasks not only share information but may also compete for resources and conflict with each other, making the optimization of shared parameters difficult and leading to suboptimal performance. We propose a simple but effective training scheme called GradSplit that alleviates this issue by utilizing asymmetric inter-task relations. Specifically, at each convolution module, it splits features into T groups for T tasks and trains each group only using the gradient back-propagated from the task losses with which it does not have conflicts. During training, we apply GradSplit to a series of convolution modules. As a result, each module is trained to generate a set of task-specific features using the shared features from the previous module. This enables a network to use complementary information across tasks while circumventing gradient conflicts. Experimental results show that GradSplit achieves a better accuracy-efficiency trade-off than existing methods.

A multi-task framework is favorable for sharing information across tasks under restricted computational resources. However, tasks not only share information but may also compete for resources and conflict with each other, making the optimization of shared parameters difficult and leading to suboptimal performance. We propose a simple but effective training scheme called GradSplit that alleviates this issue by utilizing asymmetric inter-task relations. Specifically, at each convolution module, it splits features into T groups for T tasks and trains each group only using the gradient back-propagated from the task losses with which it does not have conflicts. During training, we apply GradSplit to a series of convolution modules. As a result, each module is trained to generate a set of task-specific features using the shared features from the previous module. This enables a network to use complementary information across tasks while circumventing gradient conflicts. Experimental results show that GradSplit achieves a better accuracy-efficiency trade-off than existing methods. It minimizes accuracy drop caused by task conflicts while significantly saving compute resources in terms of both FLOPs and memory at inference. We further show that GradSplit achieves higher cross-dataset accuracy compared to single-task and other multi-task networks."

Graph Convolutional networks (GCNs) allow for the preservation of the topologies of hands poses and shapes by modeling them as a graph. In this work, we propose the THOR-Net which combines the power of GCNs, Transformer, and self-supervision to realistically reconstruct two hands and an object from a single RGB image. Our network comprises two stages; namely the features extraction stage and the reconstruction stage. In the features extraction stage, a Keypoint RCNN is used to extract 2D poses, features maps, heatmaps, and bounding boxes from a monocular RGB image. Thereafter, this 2D information is modeled as two graphs and passed to the two branches of the reconstruction stage. The shape reconstruction branch estimates meshes of two hands and an object using our novel coarse-to-fine GraFormer shape network. The 3D poses of the hands and objects are reconstructed by the other branch using a GraFormer network. Finally, a self-supervised photometric loss is used to directly regress the realistic textured of each vertex in the hands' meshes. Our approach achieves State-of-the-art results in Hand shape estimation on the HO3D dataset (10.0mm) exceeding ArtiBoost (10.8mm). It also surpasses other methods in hand pose estimation on the challenging two hands and object (H2O) dataset by 5mm on the left-hand pose and 1 mm on the right-hand pose.

TI2Net: Temporal Identity Inconsistency Network for Deepfake Detection,"Baoping Liu, Bo Liu, Ming Ding, Tianqing Zhu, Xin Yu","Data61, CSIRO, Sydney, NSW, Australia; University of Technology Sydney, NSW, Australia",100,Australia,0,,"In this paper, we propose a Temporal Identity Inconsistency Network (TI2Net), a Deepfake detector that focuses on temporal identity inconsistency. Specifically, TI2Net recognizes fake videos by capturing the dissimilarities of human faces among video frames of the same identity. Therefore, TI2Net is a reference-agnostic detector and can be used on unseen datasets. For a video clip of a given identity, identity information in all frames will first be encoded to identity vectors. TI2Net learns the temporal identity embedding from the temporal difference of the identity vectors. The temporal embedding, representing the identity inconsistency in the video clip, is finally used to determine the authenticity of the video clip.

Text-Guided Object Detector for Multi-Modal Video Question Answering,"Ruoyue Shen, Nakamasa Inoue, Koichi Shinoda",Tokyo Institute of Technology,100,Japan,0,,"Video Question Answering (Video QA) is a task to answer a text-format question based on the understanding of linguistic semantics, visual information, and also linguistic-visual alignment in the video. In Video QA, an object detector pre-trained with large-scale datasets, such as Faster R-CNN, has been widely used to extract visual representations from video frames. However, it is not always able to precisely detect the objects needed to answer the question because of the domain gaps between the datasets for training the object detector and those for Video QA.

The Box Size Confidence Bias Harms Your Object Detector,"Johannes Gilg, Torben Teepe, Fabian Herzog, Gerhard Rigoll",Technical University of Munich,100,Germany,0,,"Countless applications depend on accurate predictions with reliable confidence estimates from modern object detectors. However, it is well known that neural networks, including object detectors, produce miscalibrated confidence estimates. Recent work even suggests that detectors' confidence predictions are biased with respect to object size and position. In object detection, the issues of conditional biases, confidence calibration, and task performance are usually explored in isolation, but, as we aim to show, they are closely related. We formally prove that the conditional confidence bias harms the performance of object detectors and empirically validate these findings. Specifically, to quantify the performance impact of the confidence bias on object detectors, we modify the histogram binning calibration to avoid performance impairment and instead improve it through calibration conditioned on the bounding box size. We further find that the confidence bias is also present in detections generated on the training data of the detector, which can be leveraged to perform the de-biasing. Moreover, we show that Test Time Augmentation (TTA) confounds this bias, which results in even more significant performance impairments on the detectors. Finally, we use our proposed algorithm to analyze a diverse set of object detection architectures and show that the conditional confidence bias harms their performance by up to 0.6 mAP and 0.8 mAP50.

Towards Discriminative and Transferable One-Stage Few-Shot Object Detectors,"Karim Guirguis, Mohamed Abdelsamad, George Eskandar, Ahmed Hendawy, Matthias Kayser, Bin Yang, J√ºrgen Beyerer",University of Stuttgart; Robert Bosch GmbH‚Ä†Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology‚Ä†Fraunhofer IOSB,100,Germany,0,,"Recent object detection models have proved valuable for many robotics and manufacturing tasks, but they require large amounts of annotated data for each new class of objects they are trained for. Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to address this problem by learning novel classes given only a few samples of annotated data. While competitive results have been achieved using two-stage FSOD detectors, typically faster one-stage FSODs underperform in comparison. We make the discovery that the large gap in performance between two-stage and one-stage FSODs is mainly due to their weak discriminability, which is explained away by a small post-fusion receptive field and a small number of foreground samples in the loss function. We propose a new one-stage FSOD framework to address these limitations - Few-shot RetinaNet (FSRN). Specifically, we propose: (1) a multi-way support training strategy to augment the number of foreground samples for dense meta-detectors during training, (2) an early multi-level feature fusion providing a wide receptive field that covers the whole anchor area, (3) two augmentation techniques on query and source images to enhance transferability.

Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to address this problem by learning novel classes given only a few samples. While competitive results have been achieved using two-stage FSOD detectors, typically one-stage FSODs under-perform compared to them. We make the observation that the large gap in performance between two-stage and one-stage FSODs are mainly due to their weak discriminability, which is explained by a small post-fusion receptive field and a small number of foreground samples in the loss function. To address these limitations, we propose the Few-shot RetinaNet (FSRN) that consists of: a multi-way support training strategy to augment the number of foreground samples for dense meta-detectors, an early multi-level feature fusion providing a wide receptive field that covers the whole anchor area and two augmentation techniques on query and source images to enhance transferability. Extensive experiments show that the proposed approach addresses the limitations and boosts both discriminability and transferability. FSRN is almost two times faster than two-stage FSODs while remaining competitive in accuracy, and it outperforms the state-of-the-art of one-stage meta-detectors and also some two-stage FSODs on the MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC benchmarks."

Towards a Framework for Privacy-Preserving Pedestrian Analysis,"Anil Kunchala, M√©lanie Bouroche, Bianca Schoen-Phelan",Trinity College Dublin; Technological University Dublin,100,Ireland,0,,"The design of pedestrian-friendly infrastructures plays a crucial role in creating sustainable transportation in urban environments. Analyzing pedestrian behaviour in response to existing infrastructure is pivotal to planning, maintaining, and creating more pedestrian-friendly facilities. Many approaches have been proposed to extract such behaviour by applying deep learning models to video data. Video data, however, includes an broad spectrum of privacy-sensitive information about individuals, such as their location at a given time or who they are with. Most of the existing models use privacy-invasive methodologies to track, detect, and analyse individual or group pedestrian behaviour patterns. As a step towards privacy-preserving pedestrian analysis, this paper introduces a framework to anonymize all pedestrians before analyzing their behaviors.

Analyzing pedestrian behaviour in response to existing infrastructure is pivotal to planning, maintaining, and creating more pedestrian-friendly facilities. Many approaches have been proposed to extract such behaviour by applying deep learning models to video data. Video data, however, includes an broad spectrum of privacy-sensitive information about individuals, such as their location at a given time or who they are with. Most of the existing models use privacy-invasive methodologies to track, detect, and analyse individual or group pedestrian behaviour patterns. As a step towards privacy-preserving pedestrian analysis, this paper introduces a framework to anonymize all pedestrians before analyzing their behaviors. The proposed framework leverages recent developments in 3D wireframe reconstruction and digital in-painting to represent pedestrians with quantitative wireframes by removing their images while preserving pose, shape, and background scene context.

Trans4Map: Revisiting Holistic Bird's-Eye-View Mapping From Egocentric Images to Allocentric Semantics With Vision Transformers,"Chang Chen, Jiaming Zhang, Kailun Yang, Kunyu Peng, Rainer Stiefelhagen","CV:HCI Lab, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology",100,Germany,0,,"Humans have an innate ability to sense their surroundings, as they can extract the spatial representation from the egocentric perception and form an allocentric semantic map via spatial transformation and memory updating. However, endowing mobile agents with such a spatial sensing ability is still a challenge, due to two difficulties: (1) the previous convolutional models are limited by the local receptive field, thus, struggling to capture holistic long-range dependencies during observation; (2) the excessive computational budgets required for success, often lead to a separation of the mapping pipeline into stages, resulting the entire mapping process inefficient. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end one-stage Transformer-based framework for Mapping, termed Trans4Map. Our egocentric-to-allocentric mapping process includes three steps: (1) the efficient transformer extracts the contextual features from a batch of egocentric images; (2) the proposed Bidirectional Allocentric Memory (BAM) module projects egocentric features into the allocentric memory; (3) the map decoder parses the accumulated memory and predicts the top-down semantic segmentation map.

Two-Level Data Augmentation for Calibrated Multi-View Detection,"Martin Engilberge, Haixin Shi, Zhiye Wang, Pascal Fua","EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland",100,Switzerland,0,,"Data augmentation has proven its usefulness to improve model generalization and performance. While it is commonly applied in computer vision application when it comes to multi-view systems, it is rarely used. Indeed geometric data augmentation can break the alignment among views. This is problematic since multi-view data tend to be scarce and it is expensive to annotate.

To this end, we adapt the shape of a 3D occlusion mask to complicated motions of target objects. Our flexible mask adaptation is performed by considering the temporal continuity and spatial co-occurrence of the optical flows extracted from the input video data.

Wound image analysis is a challenging problem due to the lack of availability of extensive data (labeled or unlabeled) and annotation challenges due to the shortage of well-trained wound care clinicians. To handle these challenges, we contribute WoundSeg, a large and diverse dataset of segmented wound images. Generic wound image segmentation is complex due to the heterogeneous appearance of wound area across images of similar wound types. We propose a novel image segmentation framework, WSNet, which leverages (a) wound-domain adaptive pretraining on a large unlabeled wound image collection and (b) a global-local architecture that utilizes full image and its patches to learn fine-grained details of heterogeneous wounds.

Wound image analysis is a challenging problem due to the lack of availability of extensive data (labeled or unlabeled), and annotation is also challenging due to the shortage of well-trained wound care clinicians. To handle these challenges, we contribute WoundSeg
<sup>1</sup>
, a large and diverse dataset of segmented wound images. Generic wound image segmentation is complex due to the heterogeneous appearance of wound area across images of similar wound types. We propose a novel image segmentation framework, WSNet, which leverages (a) wound-domain adaptive pretraining on a large unlabeled wound image collection and (b) a global-local architecture that utilizes full image and its patches to learn fine-grained details of heterogeneous wounds. On WoundSeg, we achieve a decent Dice score of 0.847. On existing AZH Woundcare and Medetec datasets, we establish a new state-of-the-art. Further, we show the impact of using segmentation for improving the accuracy of downstream tasks like wound area and volume prediction."
Watch Those Words: Video Falsification Detection Using Word-Conditioned Facial Motion,"Shruti Agarwal, Liwen Hu, Evonne Ng, Trevor Darrell, Hao Li, Anna Rohrbach","Pinscreen, Inc.; University of California, Berkeley",50,USA,50,USA,"In today's era of digital misinformation, we are increasingly faced with new threats posed by video falsification techniques.

In this paper, we address these problems by enhancing the alignment of the unimodal features in order to aid feature fusion, as well as enhancing the alignment between the cameras' perspective view (PV) and BEV representations. We propose X-Align, a novel end-to-end cross-modal and cross-view learning framework for BEV segmentation consisting of the following components: (i) a novel Cross-Modal Feature Alignment (X-FA) loss, (ii) an attention-based Cross-Modal Feature Fusion (X-FF) module to align multi-modal BEV features implicitly, and (iii) an auxiliary PV segmentation branch with Cross-View Segmentation Alignment (X-SA) losses to improve the PV-to-BEV transformation. We evaluate our proposed method across two commonly used benchmark datasets, i.e., nuScenes and KITTI-360. Notably, X-Align significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3 absolute mIoU points on nuScenes. We also provide extensive ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the individual components.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2023/html/Borse_X-Align_Cross-Modal_Cross-View_Alignment_for_Birds-Eye-View_Segmentation_WACV_2023_paper.html,,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2023/papers/Borse_X-Align_Cross-Modal_Cross-View_Alignment_for_Birds-Eye-View_Segmentation_WACV_2023_paper.pdf,,,,main,Poster,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10030842/,"['Computer vision', 'Laser radar', 'Fuses', 'Roads', 'Benchmark testing', 'Cameras', 'Reliability']","['Feature Fusion', 'Visual Perspective', 'Feature Alignment', 'Multimodal Features', 'Feature Fusion Module', 'Alignment Loss', 'Attention Mechanism', 'Bounding Box', 'Camera Images', 'Baseline Methods', 'Fusion Method', 'Semantic Features', 'Computational Overhead', 'Feature Aggregation', 'Segmentation Map', 'Focal Loss', 'Depth Estimation', 'Fusion Strategy', 'Intermediate Features', 'Feature Pyramid Network', 'Camera Features', 'Simple Concatenation', '3D Object Detection', 'LiDAR Point Clouds', 'Lack Of Reliable Information', 'Deformable Convolution']","['Applications: Robotics', 'Image recognition and understanding (object detection', 'categorization', 'segmentation', 'scene modeling', 'visual reasoning)', 'Virtual/augmented reality']",12,"Bird‚Äôs-eye-view (BEV) grid is a typical representation of the perception of road components, e.g., drivable area, in autonomous driving.

X-NeRF: Explicit Neural Radiance Field for Multi-Scene 360deg Insufficient RGB-D Views,Haoyi Zhu,"Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China",100,China,0,,"Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), despite their outstanding performance on novel view synthesis, often need dense input views. Many papers train one model for each scene respectively and few of them explore incorporating multi-modal data into this problem. In this paper, we focus on a rarely discussed but important setting: can we train one model that can represent multiple scenes, with 360deg insufficient views and RGB-D images? We refer insufficient views to few extremely sparse and almost non-overlapping views. To deal with it, X-NeRF, a fully explicit approach which learns a general scene completion process instead of a coordinate-based mapping, is proposed. Given a few insufficient RGB-D input views, X-NeRF first transforms them to a sparse point cloud tensor and then applies a 3D sparse generative Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to complete it to an explicit radiance field whose volumetric rendering can be conducted fast without running networks during inference. To avoid overfitting, besides common rendering loss, we apply perceptual loss as well as view augmentation through random rotation on point clouds. The proposed methodology significantly out-performs previous implicit methods in our setting, indicating the great potential of proposed problem and approach.

Zero-Shot Versus Many-Shot: Unsupervised Texture Anomaly Detection,"Toshimichi Aota, Lloyd Teh Tzer Tong, Takayuki Okatani","Sanoh Industrial Co., Ltd.; Tohoku University / RIKEN AIP",50,Japan,50,Japan,"Research on unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) has recently progressed, significantly increasing detection accuracy. This paper focuses on texture images and considers how few normal samples are needed for accurate AD. We first highlight the critical nature of the problem that previous studies have overlooked: accurate detection gets harder for anisotropic textures when image orientations are not aligned between inputs and normal samples. We then propose a zero-shot method, which detects anomalies without using a normal sample. The method is free from the issue of unaligned orientation between input and normal images. It assumes the input texture to be homogeneous, detecting image regions that break the homogeneity as anomalies. We present a quantitative criterion to judge whether this assumption holds for an input texture.

iColoriT: Towards Propagating Local Hints to the Right Region in Interactive Colorization by Leveraging Vision Transformer,"Jooyeol Yun, Sanghyeon Lee, Minho Park, Jaegul Choo",Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST),100,South Korea,0,,"Point-interactive image colorization aims to colorize grayscale images when a user provides the colors for specific locations. It is essential for point-interactive colorization methods to appropriately propagate user-provided colors (i.e., user hints) in the entire image to obtain a reasonably colorized image with minimal user effort. However, existing approaches often produce partially colorized results due to the inefficient design of stacking convolutional layers to propagate hints to distant relevant regions. To address this problem, we present iColoriT, a novel point-interactive colorization Vision Transformer capable of propagating user hints to relevant regions, leveraging the global receptive field of Transformers. The self-attention mechanism of Transformers enables iColoriT to selectively colorize relevant regions with only a few local hints. Our approach colorizes images in real-time by utilizing pixel shuffling, an efficient upsampling technique that replaces the decoder architecture. Also, in order to mitigate the artifacts caused by pixel shuffling with large upsampling ratios, we present the local stabilizing layer.
