3C-Net: Category Count and Center Loss for Weakly-Supervised Action Localization,"Sanath Narayan, Hisham Cholakkal, Fahad Shahbaz Khan, Ling Shao","Inception Institute of ArtiÔ¨Åcial Intelligence, UAE",100.0,uae,0.0,,"Temporal action localization is a challenging computer vision problem with numerous real-world applications. Most existing methods require laborious frame-level supervision to train action localization models. In this work, we propose a framework, called 3C-Net, which only requires video-level supervision (weak supervision) in the form of action category labels and the corresponding count. We introduce a novel formulation to learn discriminative action features with enhanced localization capabilities. Our joint formulation has three terms: a classification term to ensure the separability of learned action features, an adapted multi-label center loss term to enhance the action feature discriminability and a counting loss term to delineate adjacent action sequences, leading to improved localization. Comprehensive experiments are performed on two challenging benchmarks: THUMOS14 and ActivityNet 1.2.

3D Face Modeling From Diverse Raw Scan Data,"Feng Liu, Luan Tran, Xiaoming Liu","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing MI 48824",100.0,usa,0.0,,"Traditional 3D face models learn a latent representation of faces using linear subspaces from limited scans of a single database.

3D Instance Segmentation via Multi-Task Metric Learning,"Jean Lahoud, Bernard Ghanem, Marc Pollefeys, Martin R.

By extensively evaluating a wide range of detectors on VIDT, we show that most methods drastically increase the detection delay but still preserve mAP well. In other words, mAP is not sensitive enough to reflect the temporal characteristics of a video object detector. Our results suggest that video object detection methods should be evaluated with a delay metric, particularly for latency-critical applications such as autonomous vehicle perception."

In this paper, we address the domain adaptation problem from the perspective of robust learning and show that the problem may be formulated as training with noisy labels. We propose a robust object detection framework that is resilient to noise in bounding box class labels, locations and size annotations. To adapt to the domain shift, the model is trained on the target domain using a set of noisy object bounding boxes that are obtained by a detection model trained only in the source domain. We evaluate the accuracy of our approach in various source/target domain pairs and demonstrate that the model significantly improves the state-of-the-art on multiple domain adaptation scenarios on the SIM10K, Cityscapes and KITTI datasets."
A Tour of Convolutional Networks Guided by Linear Interpreters,"Pablo Navarrete Michelini, Hanwen Liu, Yunhua Lu, Xingqun Jiang","BOE Technology Co., Ltd.",0.0,,100.0,China,"Convolutional networks are large linear systems divided into layers and connected by non-linear units. These units are the ""articulations"" that allow the network to adapt to the input. To understand how a network manages to solve a problem we must look at the articulated decisions in entirety. If we could capture the actions of non-linear units for a particular input, we would be able to replay the whole system back and forth as if it was always linear. It would also reveal the actions of non-linearities because the resulting linear system, a Linear Interpreter, depends on the input image. We introduce a hooking layer, called a LinearScope, which allows us to run the network and the linear interpreter in parallel. Its implementation is simple, flexible and efficient. From here we can make many curious inquiries: how do these linear systems look like? When the rows and columns of the transformation matrix are images, how do they look like?

In order to optimize the AFD-Net, we borrow the large margin cosine loss which can minimize intra-class distance and maximize inter-class distance between matching and non-matching samples. Extensive experiments show that AFD-Net largely outperforms the state-of-the-arts on the cross-spectral dataset, meanwhile, demonstrates a considerable generalizability on a single spectral dataset."

Accelerated Gravitational Point Set Alignment With Altered Physical Laws,"Vladislav Golyanik, Christian Theobalt, Didier Stricker","MPI for Informatics; University of Kaiserslautern, DFKI",100.0,"Germany, germany",0.0,,"This work describes Barnes-Hut Rigid Gravitational Approach (BH-RGA) -- a new rigid point set registration method relying on principles of particle dynamics. Interpreting the inputs as two interacting particle swarms, we directly minimise the gravitational potential energy of the system using non-linear least squares. Compared to solutions obtained by solving systems of second-order ordinary differential equations, our approach is more robust and less dependent on the parameter choice. We accelerate otherwise exhaustive particle interactions with a Barnes-Hut tree and efficiently handle massive point sets in quasilinear time while preserving the globally multiply-linked character of interactions.

Adaptive Density Map Generation for Crowd Counting,"Jia Wan, Antoni Chan","Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong",100.0,Hong Kong,0.0,,"Crowd counting is an important topic in computer vision due to its practical usage in surveillance systems. The typical design of crowd counting algorithms is divided into two steps. First, the ground-truth density maps of crowd images are generated from the ground-truth dot maps (density map generation), e.g., by convolving with a Gaussian kernel. Second, deep learning models are designed to predict a density map from an input image (density map estimation). Most research efforts have concentrated on the density map estimation problem, while the problem of density map generation has not been adequately explored. In particular, the density map could be considered as an intermediate representation used to train a crowd counting network. In the sense of end-to-end training, the hand-crafted methods used for generating the density maps may not be optimal for the particular network or dataset used. To address this issue, we first show the impact of different density maps and that better ground-truth density maps can be obtained by refining the existing ones using a learned refinement network, which is jointly trained with the counter.

The typical design of crowd counting algorithms is divided into two steps. First, the ground-truth density maps of crowd images are generated from the ground-truth dot maps (density map generation), e.g., by convolving with a Gaussian kernel. Second, deep learning models are designed to predict a density map from an input image (density map estimation). Most research efforts have concentrated on the density map estimation problem, while the problem of density map generation has not been adequately explored. In particular, the density map could be considered as an intermediate representation used to train a crowd counting network. In the sense of end-to-end training, the hand-crafted methods used for generating the density maps may not be optimal for the particular network or dataset used. To address this issue, we first show the impact of different density maps and that better ground-truth density maps can be obtained by refining the existing ones using a learned refinement network, which is jointly trained with the counter. Then, we propose an adaptive density map generator, which takes the annotation dot map as input, and learns a density map representation for a counter.

Adversarial Representation Learning for Text-to-Image Matching,"Nikolaos Sarafianos, Xiang Xu, Ioannis A. Kakadiaris","Computational Biomedicine Lab, University of Houston",100.0,USA,0.0,,"For many computer vision applications such as image captioning, visual question answering, and person search, learning discriminative feature representations at both image and text level is an essential yet challenging problem.

Attentional Feature-Pair Relation Networks for Accurate Face Recognition,"Bong-Nam Kang, Yonghyun Kim, Bongjin Jun, Daijin Kim","POSTECH; StradVision, Inc.; Kakao Corp.",33.33333333333333,south korea,66.66666666666667,USA,"Human face recognition is one of the most important research areas in biometrics. However, the robust face recognition under a drastic change of the facial pose, expression, and illumination is a big challenging problem for its practical application. Such variations make face recognition more difficult. In this paper, we propose a novel face recognition method, called Attentional Feature-pair Relation Network (AFRN), which represents the face by the relevant pairs of local appearance block features with their attention scores. The AFRN represents the face by all possible pairs of the 9x9 local appearance block features, the importance of each pair is considered by the attention map that is obtained from the low-rank bilinear pooling, and each pair is weighted by its corresponding attention score.

AutoFocus: Efficient Multi-Scale Inference,"Mahyar Najibi, Bharat Singh, Larry S. Davis","University of Maryland, College Park",100.0,usa,0.0,,"This paper describes AutoFocus, an efficient multi-scale inference algorithm for deep-learning based object detectors. Instead of processing an entire image pyramid, AutoFocus adopts a coarse to fine approach and only processes regions which are likely to contain small objects at finer scales. This is achieved by predicting category agnostic segmentation maps for small objects at coarser scales, called FocusPixels. FocusPixels can be predicted with high recall, and in many cases, they only cover a small fraction of the entire image. To make efficient use of FocusPixels, an algorithm is proposed which generates compact rectangular FocusChips which enclose FocusPixels.

Instead of processing an entire image pyramid, AutoFocus adopts a coarse to fine approach and only processes regions which are likely to contain small objects at finer scales. This is achieved by predicting category agnostic segmentation maps for small objects at coarser scales, called FocusPixels. FocusPixels can be predicted with high recall, and in many cases, they only cover a small fraction of the entire image. To make efficient use of FocusPixels, an algorithm is proposed which generates compact rectangular FocusChips which enclose FocusPixels. The detector is only applied inside FocusChips, which reduces computation while processing finer scales.

Bayesian Graph Convolution LSTM for Skeleton Based Action Recognition,"Rui Zhao, Kang Wang, Hui Su, Qiang Ji","RPI; RPI, IBM Research",100.0,usa,0.0,,"We propose a framework for recognizing human actions from skeleton data by modeling the underlying dynamic process that generates the motion pattern.

Bilateral Adversarial Training: Towards Fast Training of More Robust Models Against Adversarial Attacks,"Jianyu Wang, Haichao Zhang",Baidu Research USA,0.0,,100.0,China,"In this paper, we study fast training of adversarially robust models. From the analyses of the state-of-the-art defense method, i.e., the multi-step adversarial training [??], we hypothesize that the gradient magnitude links to the model robustness. Motivated by this, we propose to perturb both the image and the label during training, which we call Bilateral Adversarial Training (BAT). To generate the adversarial label, we derive an closed-form heuristic solution. To generate the adversarial image, we use one-step targeted attack with the target label being the most confusing class. In the experiment, we first show that random start and the most confusing target attack effectively prevent the label leaking and gradient masking problem. Then coupled with the adversarial label part, our model significantly improves the state-of-the-art results.

Block Annotation: Better Image Annotation With Sub-Image Decomposition,"Hubert Lin, Paul Upchurch, Kavita Bala",Cornell University,100.0,usa,0.0,,"Image datasets with high-quality pixel-level annotations are valuable for semantic segmentation: labelling every pixel in an image ensures that rare classes and small objects are annotated.

Despite the attention cost of frequent task switching, we find that block annotations can be crowdsourced at higher quality compared to full-image annotation with equal monetary cost using existing annotation tools developed for full-image annotation. Surprisingly, we find that 50% pixels annotated with blocks allows semantic segmentation to achieve equivalent performance to 100% pixels annotated.

Bridging the Domain Gap for Ground-to-Aerial Image Matching,"Krishna Regmi, Mubarak Shah","Center for Research in Computer Vision, University of Central Florida",100.0,usa,0.0,,"The visual entities in cross-view (e.g. ground and aerial) images exhibit drastic domain changes due to the differences in viewpoints each set of images is captured from. Existing state-of-the-art methods address the problem by learning view-invariant images descriptors. We propose a novel method for solving this task by exploiting the gener- ative powers of conditional GANs to synthesize an aerial representation of a ground-level panorama query and use it to minimize the domain gap between the two views. The synthesized image being from the same view as the ref- erence (target) image, helps the network to preserve im- portant cues in aerial images following our Joint Feature Learning approach. We fuse the complementary features from a synthesized aerial image with the original ground- level panorama features to obtain a robust query represen- tation.

CDPN: Coordinates-Based Disentangled Pose Network for Real-Time RGB-Based 6-DoF Object Pose Estimation,"Zhigang Li, Gu Wang, Xiangyang Ji","Tsinghua University, Beijing, China",100.0,China,0.0,,"6-DoF object pose estimation from a single RGB image is a fundamental and long-standing problem in computer vision. Current leading approaches solve it by training deep networks to either regress both rotation and translation from image directly or to construct 2D-3D correspondences and further solve them via PnP indirectly. We argue that rotation and translation should be treated differently for their significant difference. In this work, we propose a novel 6-DoF pose estimation approach: Coordinates-based Disentangled Pose Network (CDPN), which disentangles the pose to predict rotation and translation separately to achieve highly accurate and robust pose estimation. Our method is flexible, efficient, highly accurate and can deal with texture-less and occluded objects.

CFSNet: Toward a Controllable Feature Space for Image Restoration,"Wei Wang, Ruiming Guo, Yapeng Tian, Wenming Yang",University of Rochester; Tsinghua University; Chinese University of Hong Kong,100.0,"China, Hong Kong, usa",0.0,,"Deep learning methods have witnessed the great progress in image restoration with specific metrics (e.g., PSNR, SSIM).

CIIDefence: Defeating Adversarial Attacks by Fusing Class-Specific Image Inpainting and Image Denoising,"Puneet Gupta, Esa Rahtu","IIT Indore, Indore, India; Tampere University, Finland",100.0,"India, finland",0.0,,"This paper presents a novel approach for protecting deep neural networks from adversarial attacks, i.e., methods that add well-crafted imperceptible modifications to the original inputs such that they are incorrectly classified with high confidence.

Canonical Surface Mapping via Geometric Cycle Consistency,"Nilesh Kulkarni, Abhinav Gupta, Shubham Tulsiani",Carnegie Mellon University; Facebook AI Research,50.0,usa,50.0,USA,"We explore the task of Canonical Surface Mapping (CSM). Specifically, given an image, we learn to map pixels on the object to their corresponding locations on an abstract 3D model of the category. But how do we learn such a mapping? A supervised approach would require extensive manual labeling which is not scalable beyond a few hand-picked categories. Our key insight is that the CSM task (pixel to 3D), when combined with 3D projection (3D to pixel), completes a cycle.

CapsuleVOS: Semi-Supervised Video Object Segmentation Using Capsule Routing,"Kevin Duarte, Yogesh S. Rawat, Mubarak Shah","Center for Research in Computer Vision, University of Central Florida",100.0,usa,0.0,,"In this work we propose a capsule-based approach for semi-supervised video object segmentation. Current video object segmentation methods are frame-based and often require optical flow to capture temporal consistency across frames which can be difficult to compute. To this end, we propose a video based capsule network, CapsuleVOS, which can segment several frames at once conditioned on a reference frame and segmentation mask. This conditioning is performed through a novel routing algorithm for attention-based efficient capsule selection. We address two challenging issues in video object segmentation: 1) segmentation of small objects and 2) occlusion of objects across time. The issue of segmenting small objects is addressed with a zooming module which allows the network to process small spatial regions of the video. Apart from this, the framework utilizes a novel memory module based on recurrent networks which helps in tracking objects when they move out of frame or are occluded. The network is trained end-to-end and we demonstrate its effectiveness on two benchmark video object segmentation datasets; it outperforms current offline approaches on the Youtube-VOS dataset while having a run-time that is almost twice as fast as competing methods.

Cluster Alignment With a Teacher for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation,"Zhijie Deng, Yucen Luo, Jun Zhu","Dept. of Comp. Sci. & Tech., Institute for AI, BNRist Lab, THBI Lab, Tsinghua University",100.0,China,0.0,,"Deep learning methods have shown promise in unsupervised domain adaptation, which aims to leverage a labeled source domain to learn a classifier for the unlabeled target domain with a different distribution. However, such methods typically learn a domain-invariant representation space to match the marginal distributions of the source and target domains, while ignoring their fine-level structures. In this paper, we propose Cluster Alignment with a Teacher (CAT) for unsupervised domain adaptation, which can effectively incorporate the discriminative clustering structures in both domains for better adaptation.

CompenNet++: End-to-End Full Projector Compensation,"Bingyao Huang, Haibin Ling",Temple University; Stony Brook University,100.0,usa,0.0,,"Full projector compensation aims to modify a projector input image such that it can compensate for both geometric and photometric disturbance of the projection surface.

Constructing Self-Motivated Pyramid Curriculums for Cross-Domain Semantic Segmentation: A Non-Adversarial Approach,"Qing Lian, Fengmao Lv, Lixin Duan, Boqing Gong",University of Electronic Science and Technology of China; Google,50.0,china,50.0,USA,"We propose a new approach, called self-motivated pyramid curriculum domain adaptation (PyCDA), to facilitate the adaptation of semantic segmentation neural networks from synthetic source domains to real target domains.

We construct a novel gated fusion network, with one particularly designed cross-gating (CG) block, to effectively encode and fuse different types of representations, e.g., the motion and content features of an input video. One POS sequence generator relies on this fused representation to predict the global syntactic structure, which is thereafter leveraged to guide the video captioning generation and control the syntax of the generated sentence.

Experimental results on two benchmark datasets, namely MSR-VTT and MSVD, demonstrate that the proposed model can well exploit complementary information from multiple representations, resulting in improved performances. Moreover, the generated global POS information can well capture the global syntactic structure of the sentence, and thus be exploited to control the syntactic structure of the description.

Controlling Neural Networks via Energy Dissipation,"Michael Moeller, Thomas M√É¬∂llenhoff, Daniel Cremers",University of Siegen; TU Munich,100.0,"Germany, germany",0.0,,"The last decade has shown a tremendous success in solving various computer vision problems with the help of deep learning techniques.

Counting With Focus for Free,"Zenglin Shi, Pascal Mettes, Cees G. M. Snoek",University of Amsterdam,100.0,Netherlands,0.0,,"This paper aims to count arbitrary objects in images. The leading counting approaches start from point annotations per object from which they construct density maps. Then, their training objective transforms input images to density maps through deep convolutional networks. We posit that the point annotations serve more supervision purposes than just constructing density maps. We introduce ways to repurpose the points for free. First, we propose supervised focus from segmentation, where points are converted into binary maps. The binary maps are combined with a network branch and accompanying loss function to focus on areas of interest. Second, we propose supervised focus from global density, where the ratio of point annotations to image pixels is used in another branch to regularize the overall density estimation. To assist both the density estimation and the focus from segmentation, we also introduce an improved kernel size estimator for the point annotations.

However, goal-driven street navigation agents have not so far been able to transfer to unseen areas without extensive retraining, and relying on simulation is not a scalable solution. Since aerial images are easily and globally accessible, we propose instead to transfer a ground view policy, from training areas to unseen (target) parts of the city, by utilizing aerial view observations.

Crowd Counting With Deep Structured Scale Integration Network,"Lingbo Liu, Zhilin Qiu, Guanbin Li, Shufan Liu, Wanli Ouyang, Liang Lin","Sun Yat-sen University; Sun Yat-sen University, DarkMatter AI Research; The University of Sydney, SenseTime Computer Vision Research Group, Australia",100.0,"China, australia",0.0,,"Automatic estimation of the number of people in unconstrained crowded scenes is a challenging task and one major difficulty stems from the huge scale variation of people. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Structured Scale Integration Network (DSSINet) for crowd counting, which addresses the scale variation of people by using structured feature representation learning and hierarchically structured loss function optimization. Unlike conventional methods which directly fuse multiple features with weighted average or concatenation, we first introduce a Structured Feature Enhancement Module based on conditional random fields (CRFs) to refine multiscale features mutually with a message passing mechanism. Specifically, each scale-specific feature is considered as a continuous random variable and passes complementary information to refine the features at other scales.

Unlike conventional methods which directly fuse multiple features with weighted average or concatenation, we first introduce a Structured Feature Enhancement Module based on conditional random fields (CRFs) to refine multiscale features mutually with a message passing mechanism. Specifically, each scale-specific feature is considered as a continuous random variable and passes complementary information to refine the features at other scales.

DPOD: 6D Pose Object Detector and Refiner,"Sergey Zakharov, Ivan Shugurov, Slobodan Ilic",Technical University of Munich; Siemens Corporate Technology,50.0,germany,50.0,Germany,"In this paper we present a novel deep learning method for 3D object detection and 6D pose estimation from RGB images. Our method, named DPOD (Dense Pose Object Detector), estimates dense multi-class 2D-3D correspondence maps between an input image and available 3D models. Given the correspondences, a 6DoF pose is computed via PnP and RANSAC. An additional RGB pose refinement of the initial pose estimates is performed using a custom deep learning-based refinement scheme.

Instead, of employing ""blind"" domain randomization, i.e., augmenting synthetic renderings with random backgrounds or changing illumination and colorization, we leverage the task network as its own adversarial guide toward useful augmentations that maximize the uncertainty of the output. To this end, we design a min-max optimization scheme where a given task competes against a special deception network to minimize the task error subject to the specific constraints enforced by the deceiver.

In this work, we propose a novel method which realizes a single-shot deep depth measurement based on physical depth cue using only an off-the-shelf camera and lens. When a defocused image is taken by a camera, it contains various types of aberrations corresponding to distances from the image sensor and positions in the image plane. We call these minute and complexly compound aberrations as Aberration Map (A-Map) and we found that A-Map can be utilized as reliable physical depth cue. Additionally, our deep network named A-Map Analysis Network (AMA-Net) is also proposed, which can effectively learn and estimate depth via A-Map. To evaluate validity and robustness of our approach, we have conducted extensive experiments using both real outdoor scenes and simulated images. The qualitative result shows the accuracy and availability of the method in comparison with a state-of-the-art deep context-based method."

Deep Head Pose Estimation Using Synthetic Images and Partial Adversarial Domain Adaption for Continuous Label Spaces,"Felix Kuhnke, J√É¬∂rn Ostermann","Institut f¬®ur Informationsverarbeitung, Leibniz University Hannover, Germany",100.0,germany,0.0,,"Head pose estimation aims at predicting an accurate pose from an image.

Deep Reinforcement Active Learning for Human-in-the-Loop Person Re-Identification,"Zimo Liu, Jingya Wang, Shaogang Gong, Huchuan Lu, Dacheng Tao","Dalian University of Technology; Queen Mary University of London; UBTECH Sydney AI Center, The University of Sydney",100.0,"australia, china, uk",0.0,,"Most existing person re-identification(Re-ID) approaches achieve superior results based on the assumption that a large amount of pre-labelled data is usually available and can be put into training phrase all at once. However, this assumption is not applicable to most real-world deployment of the Re-ID task. In this work, we propose an alternative reinforcement learning based human-in-the-loop model which releases the restriction of pre-labelling and keeps model upgrading with progressively collected data. The goal is to minimize human annotation efforts while maximizing Re-ID performance. It works in an iteratively updating framework by refining the RL policy and CNN parameters alternately. In particular, we formulate a Deep Reinforcement Active Learning (DRAL) method to guide an agent (a model in a reinforcement learning process) in selecting training samples on-the-fly by a human user/annotator.

In this work, we propose an alternative reinforcement learning based human-in-the-loop model which releases the restriction of pre-labelling and keeps model upgrading with progressively collected data. The goal is to minimize human annotation efforts while maximizing Re-ID performance. It works in an iteratively updating framework by refining the RL policy and CNN parameters alternately. In particular, we formulate a Deep Reinforcement Active Learning (DRAL) method to guide an agent (a model in a reinforcement learning process) in selecting training samples on-the-fly by a human user/annotator. The reinforcement learning reward is the uncertainty value of each human selected sample. A binary feedback (positive or negative) labelled by the human annotator is used to select the samples of which are used to fine-tune a pre-trained CNN Re-ID model.

One key feature of our network is that it fuses different scales of image features into the 3D space through volumetric feature transformation, which helps to recover accurate surface geometry. The surface details are further refined through a normal refinement network, which can be concatenated with the volume generation network using our proposed volumetric normal projection layer. We also contribute THuman, a 3D real-world human model dataset containing approximately 7000 models. The network is trained using training data generated from the dataset.

Most of the current competitive methods directly train a network to learn a mapping from sparse depth inputs to dense depth maps, which has difficulties in utilizing the 3D geometric constraints and handling the practical sensor noises. In this paper, to regularize the depth completion and improve the robustness against noise, we propose a unified CNN framework that 1) models the geometric constraints between depth and surface normal in a diffusion module and 2) predicts the confidence of sparse LiDAR measurements to mitigate the impact of noise. Specifically, our encoder-decoder backbone predicts the surface normal, coarse depth and confidence of LiDAR inputs simultaneously, which are subsequently inputted into our diffusion refinement module to obtain the final completion results. Extensive experiments on KITTI depth completion dataset and NYU-Depth-V2 dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Further ablation study and analysis give more insights into the proposed components and demonstrate the generalization capability and stability of our model."

Detecting 11K Classes: Large Scale Object Detection Without Fine-Grained Bounding Boxes,"Hao Yang, Hao Wu, Hao Chen",Amazon Web Services,0.0,,100.0,USA,"Recent advances in deep learning greatly boost the performance of object detection.

Our proposed loss disentanglement has the twofold advantage of simplifying the training dynamics in the presence of losses with complex interactions of parameters, and sidestepping the issue of balancing independent regression terms. Our solution overcomes these issues by isolating the contribution made by groups of parameters to a given loss, without changing its nature. We further apply loss disentanglement to another novel, signed Intersection-over-Union criterion-driven loss for improving 2D detection results.

Disentangling Propagation and Generation for Video Prediction,"Hang Gao, Huazhe Xu, Qi-Zhi Cai, Ruth Wang, Fisher Yu, Trevor Darrell",Columbia University; UC Berkeley; Sinovation Ventures AI Institute,100.0,"China, usa",0.0,,"A dynamic scene has two types of elements: those that move fluidly and can be predicted from previous frames, and those which are disoccluded (exposed) and cannot be extrapolated.

The segmentation network is trained without any information about target domains and tested on the unseen target domains. To this end, we propose a new approach of domain randomization and pyramid consistency to learn a model with high generalizability. First, we propose to randomize the synthetic images with styles of real images in terms of visual appearances using auxiliary datasets, in order to effectively learn domain-invariant representations. Second, we further enforce pyramid consistency across different ""stylized"" images and within an image, in order to learn domain-invariant and scale-invariant features, respectively. Extensive experiments are conducted on generalization from GTA and SYNTHIA to Cityscapes, BDDS, and Mapillary; and our method achieves superior results over the state-of-the-art techniques.

Dynamic Anchor Feature Selection for Single-Shot Object Detection,"Shuai Li, Lingxiao Yang, Jianqiang Huang, Xian-Sheng Hua, Lei Zhang","DAMO Academy, Alibaba Group; The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, DAMO Academy, Alibaba Group; The Hong Kong Polytechnic University",100.0,"Hong Kong, china",0.0,,"The design of anchors is critical to the performance of one-stage detectors. Recently, the anchor refinement module (ARM) has been proposed to adjust the initialization of default anchors, providing the detector a better anchor reference. However, this module brings another problem: all pixels at a feature map have the same receptive field while the anchors associated with each pixel have different positions and sizes. This discordance may lead to a less effective detector. In this paper, we present a dynamic feature selection operation to select new pixels in a feature map for each refined anchor received from the ARM. The pixels are selected based on the new anchor position and size so that the receptive filed of these pixels can fit the anchor areas well, which makes the detector, especially the regression part, much easier to optimize.

Recently, the anchor refinement module (ARM) has been proposed to adjust the initialization of default anchors, providing the detector a better anchor reference. However, this module brings another problem: all pixels at a feature map have the same receptive field while the anchors associated with each pixel have different positions and sizes. This discordance may lead to a less effective detector. In this paper, we present a dynamic feature selection operation to select new pixels in a feature map for each refined anchor received from the ARM. The pixels are selected based on the new anchor position and size so that the receptive filed of these pixels can fit the anchor areas well, which makes the detector, especially the regression part, much easier to optimize. Furthermore, to enhance the representation ability of selected feature pixels, we design a bidirectional feature fusion module by combining features from early and deep layers.

We conduct experiments on challenging human action datasets: Kinetics 400, UCF101, HMDB51. The experiments using the proposed DynamoNet show promising results on all the datasets."

Ego-Pose Estimation and Forecasting As Real-Time PD Control,"Ye Yuan, Kris Kitani",Carnegie Mellon University,100.0,usa,0.0,,"We propose the use of a proportional-derivative (PD) control based policy learned via reinforcement learning (RL) to estimate and forecast 3D human pose from egocentric videos.

Escaping Plato√¢¬Ä¬ôs Cave: 3D Shape From Adversarial Rendering,"Philipp Henzler, Niloy J.

The key idea is to train a deep neural network to generate 3D shapes which, when rendered to images, are indistinguishable from ground truth images (for a discriminator) under various camera poses. Discriminating 2D images instead of 3D shapes allows tapping into unstructured 2D photo collections instead of relying on curated (e.g., aligned, annotated, etc.) 3D data sets. To establish constraints between 2D image observation and their 3D interpretation, we suggest a family of rendering layers that are effectively differentiable. This family includes visual hull, absorption-only (akin to x-ray), and emission-absorption. We can successfully reconstruct 3D shapes from unstructured 2D images and extensively evaluate PlatonicGAN on a range of synthetic and real data sets achieving consistent improvements over baseline methods.

EvalNorm: Estimating Batch Normalization Statistics for Evaluation,"Saurabh Singh, Abhinav Shrivastava","University of Maryland, College Park; Google Research",50.0,usa,50.0,USA,"Batch normalization (BN) has been very effective for deep learning and is widely used. However, when training with small minibatches, models using BN exhibit a significant degradation in performance. In this paper we study this peculiar behavior of BN to gain a better understanding of the problem, and identify a cause.

We predict two consecutive frames for temporally coherent video results and introduce a separate pipeline for realistic face synthesis. Although our method is quite simple, it produces surprisingly compelling results (see video).

Expert Sample Consensus Applied to Camera Re-Localization,"Eric Brachmann, Carsten Rother","Visual Learning Lab, Heidelberg University (HCI/IWR)",100.0,germany,0.0,,"Fitting model parameters to a set of noisy data points is a common problem in computer vision. In this work, we fit the 6D camera pose to a set of noisy correspondences between the 2D input image and a known 3D environment.

Exploiting Temporal Consistency for Real-Time Video Depth Estimation,"Haokui Zhang, Chunhua Shen, Ying Li, Yuanzhouhan Cao, Yu Liu, Youliang Yan","University of Adelaide; Noah‚Äôs Ark Lab, Huawei; Northwestern Polytechnical University",66.66666666666666,"australia, china",33.33333333333334,China,"Accuracy of depth estimation from static images has been significantly improved recently, by exploiting hierarchical features from deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Compared with static images, vast information exists among video frames and can be exploited to improve the depth estimation performance.

Specifically, we take the advantage of convolutional long short-term memory (CLSTM) and propose a novel spatial-temporal CSLTM (ST-CLSTM) structure. Our ST-CLSTM structure can capture not only the spatial features but also the temporal correlations/consistency among consecutive video frames with negligible increase in computational cost.

FDA: Feature Disruptive Attack,"Aditya Ganeshan, Vivek B.S., R. Venkatesh Babu","Video Analytics Lab, Indian Institute of Science, India; Preferred Networks Inc., Tokyo, Japan",50.0,India,50.0,Japan,"Though Deep Neural Networks (DNN) show excellent performance across various computer vision tasks, several works show their vulnerability to adversarial samples, i.e., image samples with imperceptible noise engineered to manipulate the network's prediction. Adversarial sample generation methods range from simple to complex optimization techniques. Majority of these methods generate adversaries through optimization objectives that are tied to the pre-softmax or softmax output of the network. In this work we, (i) show the drawbacks of such attacks, (ii) propose two new evaluation metrics: Old Label New Rank (OLNR) and New Label Old Rank (NLOR) in order to quantify the extent of damage made by an attack, and (iii) propose a new attack FDA: Feature Disruptive attack, to address the drawbacks of existing attacks. FDA works by generating image perturbation that disrupts features at each layer of the network and causes deep-features to be highly corrupt.

In this work we, (i) show the drawbacks of such attacks, (ii) propose two new evaluation metrics: Old Label New Rank (OLNR) and New Label Old Rank (NLOR) in order to quantify the extent of damage made by an attack, and (iii) propose a new attack FDA: Feature Disruptive attack, to address the drawbacks of existing attacks. FDA works by generating image perturbation that disrupts features at each layer of the network and causes deep-features to be highly corrupt.

Existing algorithms encoded an image as a global feature vector and performed retrieval with the global representation. However, discriminative local information on clothes are submerged in this global representation, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Graph Reasoning Network (GRNet) on a Similarity Pyramid, which learns similarities between a query and a gallery cloth by using both global and local representations in multiple scales. The similarity pyramid is represented by a Graph of similarity, where nodes represent similarities between clothing components at different scales, and the final matching score is obtained by message passing along edges. In GRNet, graph reasoning is solved by training a graph convolutional network, enabling to align salient clothing components to improve clothing retrieval.

Existing algorithms mostly encode an image as a global feature vector and perform retrieval via global representation matching. However, distinctive local information on clothing is immersed in this global representation, resulting in sub-optimized performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel graph reasoning network (GRNet) on a similarity pyramid, which learns similarities between a query and a gallery cloth by using both initial pairwise multi-scale feature representations and matching propagation for unaligned representations. The query local representations at each scale are aligned with those of the gallery via an adaptive window pooling module. The similarity pyramid is represented by a similarity graph, where nodes represent similarities between clothing components at different scales, and the final matching score is obtained by message propagation along edges. In GRNet, graph reasoning is solved by training a graph convolutional network, enabling the alignment of salient clothing components to improve clothing retrieval.

Few-Shot Adaptive Gaze Estimation,"Seonwook Park, Shalini De Mello, Pavlo Molchanov, Umar Iqbal, Otmar Hilliges, Jan Kautz",ETH Z√ºrich; NVIDIA,50.0,Switzerland,50.0,USA,"Inter-personal anatomical differences limit the accuracy of person-independent gaze estimation networks. Yet there is a need to lower gaze errors further to enable applications requiring higher quality. Further gains can be achieved by personalizing gaze networks, ideally with few calibration samples.

We embrace these challenges and propose a novel framework for Few-shot Adaptive GaZE Estimation (Faze) for learning person-specific gaze networks with very few (<= 9) calibration samples.

The temporal variations in a video allow different regions of the target object to be activated. We obtain an activated region in each frame of a video, and then aggregate the regions from successive frames into a single image, using a warping technique based on optical flow. The resulting localization maps cover more of the target object, and can then be used as proxy ground-truth to train a segmentation network.

FreiHAND: A Dataset for Markerless Capture of Hand Pose and Shape From Single RGB Images,"Christian Zimmermann, Duygu Ceylan, Jimei Yang, Bryan Russell, Max Argus, Thomas Brox",University of Freiburg; Adobe Research,50.0,germany,50.0,USA,"Estimating 3D hand pose from single RGB images is a highly ambiguous problem that relies on an unbiased training dataset. In this paper, we analyze cross-dataset generalization when training on existing datasets. We find that approaches perform well on the datasets they are trained on, but do not generalize to other datasets or in-the-wild scenarios. As a consequence, we introduce the first large-scale, multi-view hand dataset that is accompanied by both 3D hand pose and shape annotations. For annotating this real-world dataset, we propose an iterative, semi-automated `human-in-the-loop' approach, which includes hand fitting optimization to infer both the 3D pose and shape for each sample.

As a consequence, we introduce the first large-scale, multi-view hand dataset that is accompanied by both 3D hand pose and shape annotations. For annotating this real-world dataset, we propose an iterative, semi-automated `human-in-the-loop' approach, which includes hand fitting optimization to infer both the 3D pose and shape for each sample.

From Open Set to Closed Set: Counting Objects by Spatial Divide-and-Conquer,"Haipeng Xiong, Hao Lu, Chengxin Liu, Liang Liu, Zhiguo Cao, Chunhua Shen","Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China; The University of Adelaide, Australia",100.0,"australia, china",0.0,,"Visual counting, a task that predicts the number of objects from an image/video, is an open-set problem by nature, i.e., the number of population can vary in [0,+[?]) in theory.

Though multi-mode prior or multi-generator models have been proposed to alleviate this problem, such approaches may fail depending on the empirically chosen initial mode components. In contrast to such bottom-up approaches, we present GAN-Tree, which follows a hierarchical divisive strategy to address such discontinuous multi-modal data. Devoid of any assumption on the number of modes, GAN-Tree utilizes a novel mode-splitting algorithm to effectively split the parent mode to semantically cohesive children modes, facilitating unsupervised clustering. Further, it also enables incremental addition of new data modes to an already trained GAN-Tree, by updating only a single branch of the tree structure. As compared to prior approaches, the proposed framework offers a higher degree of flexibility in choosing a large variety of mutually exclusive and exhaustive tree nodes called GAN-Set.

Our approach is based on an 'affinity measure' in Euclidean space that leads to the following benefits: (1) direct enforcement of maximum margin constraints on classification boundaries, (2) a tractable way to ensure uniformly spaced and equidistant cluster centers, (3) flexibility to learn multiple class prototypes to support diversity and discriminability in feature space. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the significant performance improvements on visual classification and verification tasks on multiple imbalanced datasets. The proposed loss can easily be plugged in any deep architecture as a differentiable block and demonstrates robustness against different levels of data imbalance and corrupted labels."
Gaussian YOLOv3: An Accurate and Fast Object Detector Using Localization Uncertainty for Autonomous Driving,"Jiwoong Choi, Dayoung Chun, Hyun Kim, Hyuk-Jae Lee",Seoul National University of Science and Technology; Seoul National University,100.0,south korea,0.0,,"The use of object detection algorithms is becoming increasingly important in autonomous vehicles, and object detection at high accuracy and a fast inference speed is essential for safe autonomous driving. A false positive (FP) from a false localization during autonomous driving can lead to fatal accidents and hinder safe and efficient driving. Therefore, a detection algorithm that can cope with mislocalizations is required in autonomous driving applications. This paper proposes a method for improving the detection accuracy while supporting a real-time operation by modeling the bounding box (bbox) of YOLOv3, which is the most representative of one-stage detectors, with a Gaussian parameter and redesigning the loss function. In addition, this paper proposes a method for predicting the localization uncertainty that indicates the reliability of bbox. By using the predicted localization uncertainty during the detection process, the proposed schemes can significantly reduce the FP and increase the true positive (TP), thereby improving the accuracy. Compared to a conventional YOLOv3, the proposed algorithm, Gaussian YOLOv3, improves the mean average precision (mAP) by 3.09 and 3.5 on the KITTI and Berkeley deep drive (BDD) datasets, respectively.

HACS: Human Action Clips and Segments Dataset for Recognition and Temporal Localization,"Hang Zhao, Antonio Torralba, Lorenzo Torresani, Zhicheng Yan",Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Dartmouth College; University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,100.0,"USA, usa",0.0,,"This paper presents a new large-scale dataset for recognition and temporal localization of human actions collected from Web videos. We refer to it as HACS (Human Action Clips and Segments). We leverage consensus and disagreement among visual classifiers to automatically mine candidate short clips from unlabeled videos, which are subsequently validated by human annotators. The resulting dataset is dubbed HACS Clips. Through a separate process we also collect annotations defining action segment boundaries. This resulting dataset is called HACS Segments. Overall, HACS Clips consists of 1.5M annotated clips sampled from 504K untrimmed videos, and HACS Segments contains 139K action segments densely annotated in 50K untrimmed videos spanning 200 action categories. HACS Clips contains more labeled examples than any existing video benchmark.

The resulting dataset is dubbed HACS Clips. Through a separate process we also collect annotations defining action segment boundaries. This resulting dataset is called HACS Segments. Overall, HACS Clips consists of 1.5M annotated clips sampled from 504K untrimmed videos, and HACS Segments contains 139K action segments densely annotated in 50K untrimmed videos spanning 200 action categories. HACS Clips contains more labeled examples than any existing video benchmark.

HAWQ: Hessian AWare Quantization of Neural Networks With Mixed-Precision,"Zhen Dong, Zhewei Yao, Amir Gholami, Michael W. Mahoney, Kurt Keutzer","University of California, Berkeley",100.0,usa,0.0,,"Model size and inference speed/power have become a major challenge in the deployment of neural networks for many applications. A promising approach to address these problems is quantization. However, uniformly quantizing a model to ultra-low precision leads to significant accuracy degradation. A novel solution for this is to use mixed-precision quantization, as some parts of the network may allow lower precision as compared to other layers. However, there is no systematic way to determine the precision of different layers. A brute force approach is not feasible for deep networks, as the search space for mixed-precision is exponential in the number of layers. Another challenge is a similar factorial complexity for determining block-wise fine-tuning order when quantizing the model to a target precision. Here, we introduce Hessian AWare Quantization (HAWQ), a novel second-order quantization method to address these problems. HAWQ allows for the automatic selection of the relative quantization precision of each layer, based on the layer's Hessian spectrum. Moreover, HAWQ provides a deterministic fine-tuning order for quantizing layers. We show the results of our method on Cifar-10 using ResNet20, and on ImageNet using Inception-V3, ResNet50 and SqueezeNext models.

Quantitative experiments show that our approach outperforms relevant baselines in steganographic capacity and fidelity."

Hierarchy Parsing for Image Captioning,"Ting Yao, Yingwei Pan, Yehao Li, Tao Mei","JD AI Research, Beijing, China",0.0,,100.0,China,"It is always well believed that parsing an image into constituent visual patterns would be helpful for understanding and representing an image.

Homography From Two Orientation- and Scale-Covariant Features,"D√É¬°niel Bar√É¬°th, Zuzana Kukelova","VRG, Department of Cybernetics, Czech Technical University in Prague, Czech Republic; VRG, Department of Cybernetics, Czech Technical University in Prague, Czech Republic; Machine Perception Research Laboratory, MTA SZTAKI, Budapest, Hungary",100.0,"Czech Republic, hungary",0.0,,"This paper proposes a geometric interpretation of the angles and scales which the orientation- and scale-covariant feature detectors, e.g. SIFT, provide. Two new general constraints are derived on the scales and rotations which can be used in any geometric model estimation tasks. Using these formulas, two new constraints on homography estimation are introduced. Exploiting the derived equations, a solver for estimating the homography from the minimal number of two correspondences is proposed.

How Do Neural Networks See Depth in Single Images?,"Tom van Dijk, Guido de Croon","Technische Universiteit Delft, Delft, The Netherlands",100.0,Netherlands,0.0,,"Deep neural networks have lead to a breakthrough in depth estimation from single images. Recent work shows that the quality of these estimations is rapidly increasing. It is clear that neural networks can see depth in single images. However, to the best of our knowledge, no work currently exists that analyzes what these networks have learned. In this work we take four previously published networks and investigate what depth cues they exploit. We find that all networks ignore the apparent size of known obstacles in favor of their vertical position in the image. The use of the vertical position requires the camera pose to be known; however, we find that these networks only partially recognize changes in camera pitch and roll angles.

Hyperspectral Image Reconstruction Using Deep External and Internal Learning,"Tao Zhang, Ying Fu, Lizhi Wang, Hua Huang","School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology",100.0,China,0.0,,"To solve the low spatial and/or temporal resolution problem which the conventional hypelrspectral cameras often suffer from, coded snapshot hyperspectral imaging systems have attracted more attention recently. Recovering a hyperspectral image (HSI) from its corresponding coded image is an ill-posed inverse problem, and learning accurate prior of HSI is essential to solve this inverse problem.

IL2M: Class Incremental Learning With Dual Memory,"Eden Belouadah, Adrian Popescu","CEA, LIST, F-91191 Gif-sur-Yvette, France",0.0,,100.0,France,"This paper presents a class incremental learning (IL) method which exploits fine tuning and a dual memory to reduce the negative effect of catastrophic forgetting in image recognition. First, we simplify the current fine tuning based approaches which use a combination of classification and distillation losses to compensate for the limited availability of past data. We find that the distillation term actually hurts performance when a memory is allowed. Then, we modify the usual class IL memory component. Similar to existing works, a first memory stores exemplar images of past classes. A second memory is introduced here to store past class statistics obtained when they were initially learned. The intuition here is that classes are best modeled when all their data are available and that their initial statistics are useful across different incremental states. A prediction bias towards newly learned classes appears during inference because the dataset is imbalanced in their favor. The challenge is to make predictions of new and past classes more comparable. To do this, scores of past classes are rectified by leveraging contents from both memories.

IMP: Instance Mask Projection for High Accuracy Semantic Segmentation of Things,"Cheng-Yang Fu, Tamara L. Berg, Alexander C.

Unlike previous image synthesis methods that transform the source person images into limited fixed target styles, our approach produces more visually plausible, and diverse synthetic training data. Specifically, we formulate a dual conditional generative adversarial network that augments each source person image with rich contextual variations. To explicitly achieve diverse rendering effects, we leverage abundant unlabelled target instances as contextual guidance for image generation. Extensive experiments on Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID and CUHK03 benchmarks show that the re-id performance can be significantly improved when using our synthetic data in cross-domain re-id model learning."

Joint Optimization for Cooperative Image Captioning,"Gilad Vered, Gal Oren, Yuval Atzmon, Gal Chechik","Bar-Ilan University, NVIDIA; Bar-Ilan University",100.0,israel,0.0,,"When describing images with natural language, descriptions can be made more informative if tuned for downstream tasks.

First, the descriptions generated by a speaker network are discrete and stochastic, making optimization very hard and inefficient. Second, joint training usually causes the vocabulary used during communication to drift and diverge from natural language.

K-Best Transformation Synchronization,"Yifan Sun, Jiacheng Zhuo, Arnav Mohan, Qixing Huang","UT Austin, Austin, TX 78712; Liberal Arts and Science Academy, Austin, TX 78745",100.0,"USA, usa",0.0,,"In this paper, we introduce the problem of K-best transformation synchronization for the purpose of multiple scan matching. Given noisy pair-wise transformations computed between a subset of depth scan pairs, K-best transformation synchronization seeks to output multiple consistent relative transformations. This problem naturally arises in many geometry reconstruction applications, where the underlying object possesses self-symmetry. For approximately symmetric or even non-symmetric objects, K-best solutions offer an intermediate presentation for recovering the underlying single-best solution.

This multi-task training is applied to a new Graph Oriented Vision-Language Embedding (GrOVLE), which we adapt from Word2Vec using WordNet and an original visual-language graph built from Visual Genome, providing a ready-to-use vision-language embedding: http://ai.bu.edu/grovle."

Language-Conditioned Graph Networks for Relational Reasoning,"Ronghang Hu, Anna Rohrbach, Trevor Darrell, Kate Saenko","Boston University; University of California, Berkeley",100.0,usa,0.0,,"Solving grounded language tasks often requires reasoning about relationships between objects in the context of a given task.

Learned Video Compression,"Oren Rippel, Sanjay Nair, Carissa Lew, Steve Branson, Alexander G. Anderson, Lubomir Bourdev","WaveOne, Inc.",0.0,,100.0,USA,"We present a new algorithm for video coding, learned end-to-end for the low-latency mode. In this setting, our approach outperforms all existing video codecs across nearly the entire bitrate range. To our knowledge, this is the first ML-based method to do so. We evaluate our approach on standard video compression test sets of varying resolutions, and benchmark against all mainstream commercial codecs in the low-latency mode. On standard-definition videos, HEVC/H.265, AVC/H.264 and VP9 typically produce codes up to 60% larger than our algorithm. On high-definition 1080p videos, H.265 and VP9 typically produce codes up to 20% larger, and H.264 up to 35% larger. Furthermore, our approach does not suffer from blocking artifacts and pixelation, and thus produces videos that are more visually pleasing. We propose two main contributions.

Such a task requires a GAN to identify a minimal subset of target pixels for domain translation, an ability that we call fixed-point translation, which no GAN is equipped with yet. Therefore, we propose a new GAN, called Fixed-Point GAN, trained by (1) supervising same-domain translation through a conditional identity loss, and (2) regularizing cross-domain translation through revised adversarial, domain classification, and cycle consistency loss. Based on fixed-point translation, we further derive a novel framework for disease detection and localization using only image-level annotation. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state of the art in multi-domain image-to-image translation and that it surpasses predominant weakly-supervised localization methods in both disease detection and localization.

Instead, we predict a distortion correction flow map that encodes a per-pixel displacement that removes distortion artifacts when applied to the input image. Our method also automatically infers missing facial features, i.e. occluded ears caused by strong perspective distortion, with coherent details. We demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art [23] both qualitatively and quantitatively, particularly for portraits with extreme perspective distortion or facial expressions. We further show that our technique benefits a number of fundamental tasks, significantly improving the accuracy of both face recognition and 3D reconstruction and enables a novel camera calibration technique from a single portrait. Moreover, we also build the first perspective portrait database with a large diversity in identities, expression and poses."

Learning Temporal Action Proposals With Fewer Labels,"Jingwei Ji, Kaidi Cao, Juan Carlos Niebles",Stanford University,100.0,usa,0.0,,"Temporal action proposals are a common module in action detection pipelines today.

Learning Trajectory Dependencies for Human Motion Prediction,"Wei Mao, Miaomiao Liu, Mathieu Salzmann, Hongdong Li","Australian National University; Australian National University, Australia Centre for Robotic Vision; CVLab, EPFL",100.0,"Australia, switzerland",0.0,,"Human motion prediction, i.e., forecasting future body poses given observed pose sequence, has typically been tackled with recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, as evidenced by prior work, the resulted RNN models suffer from prediction errors accumulation, leading to undesired discontinuities in motion prediction. In this paper, we propose a simple feed-forward deep network for motion prediction, which takes into account both temporal smoothness and spatial dependencies among human body joints. In this context, we then propose to encode temporal information by working in trajectory space, instead of the traditionally-used pose space. This alleviates us from manually defining the range of temporal dependencies (or temporal convolutional filter size, as done in previous work). Moreover, spatial dependency of human pose is encoded by treating a human pose as a generic graph (rather than a human skeletal kinematic tree) formed by links between every pair of body joints. Instead of using a pre-defined graph structure, we design a new graph convolutional network to learn graph connectivity automatically. This allows the network to capture long range dependencies beyond that of human kinematic tree. We evaluate our approach on several standard benchmark datasets for motion prediction, including Human3.6M, the CMU motion capture dataset and 3DPW.

However, existing methods over-simplify the composite nature of language into a monolithic sentence embedding or a coarse composition of subject-predicate-object triplet. In this paper, we propose to ground natural language in an intuitive, explainable, and composite fashion as it should be. In particular, we develop a novel modular network called Neural Module Tree network (NMTree) that regularizes the visual grounding along the dependency parsing tree of the sentence, where each node is a neural module that calculates visual attention according to its linguistic feature, and the grounding score is accumulated in a bottom-up direction where as needed. NMTree disentangles the visual grounding from the composite reasoning, allowing the former to only focus on primitive and easy-to-generalize patterns.

The content-augmentation step focuses on alleviating the uncertainty of pose estimation by augmenting the observation based on the co-visibility in local maps built by the VO stream. Besides, the motion-based refinement is formulated as a pose graph, where the camera poses are further optimized by adopting relative poses provided by the VO component as additional motion constraints. Thus, the global consistency can be guaranteed.

Specifically, we introduce two effective steps called content-augmented pose estimation and motion-based refinement. The content-augmentation step focuses on alleviating the uncertainty of pose estimation by augmenting the observation based on the co-visibility in local maps built by the VO stream. Besides, the motion-based refinement is formulated as a pose graph, where the camera poses are further optimized by adopting relative poses provided by the VO component as additional motion constraints. Thus, the global consistency can be guaranteed.

Memory-Based Neighbourhood Embedding for Visual Recognition,"Suichan Li, Dapeng Chen, Bin Liu, Nenghai Yu, Rui Zhao","School of Information Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China; SenseTime Research",50.0,china,50.0,China,"Learning discriminative image feature embeddings is of great importance to visual recognition. To achieve better feature embeddings, most current methods focus on designing different network structures or loss functions, and the estimated feature embeddings are usually only related to the input images. In this paper, we propose Memory-based Neighbourhood Embedding (MNE) to enhance a general CNN feature by considering its neighbourhood. The method aims to solve two critical problems, i.e., how to acquire more relevant neighbours in the network training and how to aggregate the neighbourhood information for a more discriminative embedding. We first augment an episodic memory module into the network, which can provide more relevant neighbours for both training and testing. Then the neighbours are organized in a tree graph with the target instance as the root node.

To achieve better feature embeddings, most current methods focus on designing different network structures or loss functions, and the estimated feature embeddings are usually only related to the input images. In this paper, we propose Memory-based Neighbourhood Embedding (MNE) to enhance a general CNN feature by considering its neighbourhood. The method aims to solve two critical problems, i.e., how to acquire more relevant neighbours in the network training and how to aggregate the neighbourhood information for a more discriminative embedding. We first augment an episodic memory module into the network, which can provide more relevant neighbours for both training and testing. Then the neighbours are organized in a tree graph with the target instance as the root node. The neighbourhood information is gradually aggregated to the root node in a bottom-up manner, and aggregation weights are supervised by the class relationships between the nodes.

Moreover, in order to better serve the sub-tasks, the two generators, based on context aggregation networks, utilzse different size of receptive fields, providing both local and global views of objects for segmentation. As verified on multiple infrared image data sets, our method consistently achieves better segmentation than many state-of-the-art ISOS methods."
Mixed High-Order Attention Network for Person Re-Identification,"Binghui Chen, Weihong Deng, Jiani Hu",Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications,100.0,China,0.0,,"Attention has become more attractive in person re-identification (ReID) as it is capable of biasing the allocation of available resources towards the most informative parts of an input signal.

We further introduce a series of novel motion guided attention modules, which utilize the motion saliency sub-network to attend and enhance the sub-network for still images. These two sub-networks learn to adapt to each other by end-to-end training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms on a wide range of benchmarks. We hope our simple and effective approach will serve as a solid baseline and help ease future research in video salient object detection. Code and models will be made available."

We extract patch features from the classification model and input them into the segmentation model to obtain a whole slide tumor probability heatmap. The classification model considers patch-scale local features, and the segmentation model can take global information into account. We also propose a new optimization method that retains gradient information and trains the model partially for end-to-end learning with limited GPU memory capacity. We apply our method to the tumor/normal prediction on WSIs and the classification performance is improved compared with the conventional patch-based method."

Neural Inverse Rendering of an Indoor Scene From a Single Image,"Soumyadip Sengupta, Jinwei Gu, Kihwan Kim, Guilin Liu, David W.

Inverse rendering has been studied primarily for single objects or with methods that solve for only one of the scene attributes. We propose the first learning based approach that jointly estimates albedo, normals, and lighting of an indoor scene from a single image. Our key contribution is the Residual Appearance Renderer (RAR), which can be trained to synthesize complex appearance effects (e.g., inter-reflection, cast shadows, near-field illumination, and realistic shading), which would be neglected otherwise. This enables us to perform self-supervised learning on real data using a reconstruction loss, based on re-synthesizing the input image from the estimated components.

Normalized Wasserstein for Mixture Distributions With Applications in Adversarial Learning and Domain Adaptation,"Yogesh Balaji, Rama Chellappa, Soheil Feizi","UMIACS, University of Maryland; Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland",100.0,usa,0.0,,"Understanding proper distance measures between distributions is at the core of several learning tasks such as generative models, domain adaptation, clustering, etc. In this work, we focus on mixture distributions that arise naturally in several application domains where the data contains different sub-populations. For mixture distributions, established distance measures such as the Wasserstein distance do not take into account imbalanced mixture proportions. Thus, even if two mixture distributions have identical mixture components but different mixture proportions, the Wasserstein distance between them will be large. This often leads to undesired results in distance-based learning methods for mixture distributions. In this paper, we resolve this issue by introducing the Normalized Wasserstein measure.

For mixture distributions, established distance measures such as the Wasserstein distance do not take into account imbalanced mixture proportions. Thus, even if two mixture distributions have identical mixture components but different mixture proportions, the Wasserstein distance between them will be large. This often leads to undesired results in distance-based learning methods for mixture distributions. In this paper, we resolve this issue by introducing the Normalized Wasserstein measure.

Not All Parts Are Created Equal: 3D Pose Estimation by Modeling Bi-Directional Dependencies of Body Parts,"Jue Wang, Shaoli Huang, Xinchao Wang, Dacheng Tao","Stevens Institute of Technology; UBTECH Sydney AI Centre, School of Computer Science, FEIT, University of Sydney, Darlington, NSW 2008, Australia",100.0,"australia, usa",0.0,,"Not all the human body parts have the same degree of freedom (DOF) due to the physiological structure.

Occlusion-Shared and Feature-Separated Network for Occlusion Relationship Reasoning,"Rui Lu, Feng Xue, Menghan Zhou, Anlong Ming, Yu Zhou","Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China; Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China",100.0,"China, china",0.0,,"Occlusion relationship reasoning demands closed contour to express the object, and orientation of each contour pixel to describe the order relationship between objects. Current CNN-based methods neglect two critical issues of the task: (1) simultaneous existence of the relevance and distinction for the two elements, i.e, occlusion edge and occlusion orientation; and (2) inadequate exploration to the orientation features. For the reasons above, we propose the Occlusion-shared and Feature-separated Network (OFNet). On one hand, considering the relevance between edge and orientation, two sub-networks are designed to share the occlusion cue. On the other hand, the whole network is split into two paths to learn the high semantic features separately. Moreover, a contextual feature for orientation prediction is extracted, which represents the bilateral cue of the foreground and background areas.

Current CNN-based methods neglect two critical issues of the task: (1) simultaneous existence of the relevance and distinction for the two elements, i.e, occlusion edge and occlusion orientation; and (2) inadequate exploration to the orientation features. For the reasons above, we propose the Occlusion-shared and Feature-separated Network (OFNet). On one hand, considering the relevance between edge and orientation, two sub-networks are designed to share the occlusion cue. On the other hand, the whole network is split into two paths to learn the high semantic features separately. Moreover, a contextual feature for orientation prediction is extracted, which represents the bilateral cue of the foreground and background areas. The bilateral cue is then fused with the occlusion cue to precisely locate the object regions. Finally, a stripe convolution is designed to further aggregate features from surrounding scenes of the occlusion edge.

Lawrence Zitnick","Facebook AI Research, Menlo Park, CA",0.0,,100.0,USA,"In this paper, we study the problem of sequentially building houses in the game of Minecraft, and demonstrate that learning the ordering can make for more effective autoregressive models. Given a partially built house made by a human player, our system tries to place additional blocks in a human-like manner to complete the house. We introduce a new dataset, HouseCraft, for this new task. HouseCraft contains the sequential order in which 2,500 Minecraft houses were built from scratch by humans. The human action sequences enable us to learn an order-aware generative model called Voxel-CNN. In contrast to many generative models where the sequential generation ordering either does not matter (e.g. holistic generation with GANs), or is manually/arbitrarily set by simple rules (e.g. raster-scan order), our focus is on an ordered generation that imitates humans.

Given a partially built house made by a human player, our system tries to place additional blocks in a human-like manner to complete the house. We introduce a new dataset, HouseCraft, for this new task. HouseCraft contains the sequential order in which 2,500 Minecraft houses were built from scratch by humans. The human action sequences enable us to learn an order-aware generative model called Voxel-CNN. In contrast to many generative models where the sequential generation ordering either does not matter (e.g. holistic generation with GANs), or is manually/arbitrarily set by simple rules (e.g. raster-scan order), our focus is on an ordered generation that imitates humans.

Using PIFu, we propose an end-to-end deep learning method for digitizing highly detailed clothed humans that can infer both 3D surface and texture from a single image, and optionally, multiple input images. Highly intricate shapes, such as hairstyles, clothing, as well as their variations and deformations can be digitized in a unified way. Compared to existing representations used for 3D deep learning, PIFu produces high-resolution surfaces including largely unseen regions such as the back of a person. In particular, it is memory efficient unlike the voxel representation, can handle arbitrary topology, and the resulting surface is spatially aligned with the input image.

Highly intricate shapes, such as hairstyles, clothing, as well as their variations and deformations can be digitized in a unified way. Compared to existing representations used for 3D deep learning, PIFu produces high-resolution surfaces including largely unseen regions such as the back of a person. In particular, it is memory efficient unlike the voxel representation, can handle arbitrary topology, and the resulting surface is spatially aligned with the input image.

Person Search by Text Attribute Query As Zero-Shot Learning,"Qi Dong, Shaogang Gong, Xiatian Zhu",Vision Semantics Ltd.; Queen Mary University of London,50.0,uk,50.0,UK,"Existing person search methods predominantly assume the availability of at least one-shot imagery sample of the queried person. This assumption is limited in circumstances where only a brief textual (or verbal) description of the target person is available. In this work, we present a deep learning method for attribute text description based person search without any query imagery. Whilst conventional cross-modality matching methods, such as global visual-textual embedding based zero-shot learning and local individual attribute recognition, are functionally applicable, they are limited by several assumptions invalid to person search in deployment scale, data quality, and/or category name semantics.

The mean of the distribution estimates the most likely feature values while the variance shows the uncertainty in the feature values. Probabilistic solutions can then be naturally derived for matching and fusing PFEs using the uncertainty information. Empirical evaluation on different baseline models, training datasets and benchmarks show that the proposed method can improve the face recognition performance of deterministic embeddings by converting them into PFEs. The uncertainties estimated by PFEs also serve as good indicators of the potential matching accuracy, which are important for a risk-controlled recognition system."

To capture correspondence at different semantic levels, we further propose a pyramid-like structure that models different sizes of image regions as graph nodes and undertakes graph reasoning at different levels. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset demonstrate that our proposed network significantly outperforms the baseline method and leads to new state-of-the-art performance on 1-shot and 5-shot segmentation benchmarks."

In this work, we present a novel Reciprocal Multi-layer Subspace Learning (RMSL) algorithm for multi-view clustering, which is composed of two main components: Hierarchical Self-Representative Layers (HSRL), and Backward Encoding Networks (BEN). Specifically, HSRL constructs reciprocal multi-layer subspace representations linked with a latent representation to hierarchically recover the underlying low-dimensional subspaces in which the high-dimensional data lie; BEN explores complex relationships among different views and implicitly enforces the subspaces of all views to be consistent with each other and more separable.

Specifically, HSRL constructs reciprocal multi-layer subspace representations linked with a latent representation to hierarchically recover the underlying low-dimensional subspaces in which the high-dimensional data lie; BEN explores complex relationships among different views and implicitly enforces the subspaces of all views to be consistent with each other and more separable. The latent representation flexibly encodes complementary information from multiple views and depicts data more comprehensively.

Rethinking Zero-Shot Learning: A Conditional Visual Classification Perspective,"Kai Li, Martin Renqiang Min, Yun Fu","Khoury College of Computer Science, Northeastern University, Boston, USA; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, USA; NEC Laboratories America",66.66666666666666,china,33.33333333333334,USA,"Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize instances of unseen classes solely based on the semantic descriptions of the classes. Existing algorithms usually formulate it as a semantic-visual correspondence problem, by learning mappings from one feature space to the other. Despite being reasonable, previous approaches essentially discard the highly precious discriminative power of visual features in an implicit way, and thus produce undesirable results.

SCSampler: Sampling Salient Clips From Video for Efficient Action Recognition,"Bruno Korbar, Du Tran, Lorenzo Torresani",Facebook AI,0.0,,100.0,USA,"While many action recognition datasets consist of collections of brief, trimmed videos each containing a relevant action, videos in the real-world (e.g., on YouTube) exhibit very different properties: they are often several minutes long, where brief relevant clips are often interleaved with segments of extended duration containing little change.

Furthermore, as we show in our experiments, this results in suboptimal recognition accuracy as informative predictions from relevant clips are outnumbered by meaningless classification outputs over long uninformative sections of the video. In this paper we introduce a lightweight ""clip-sampling"" model that can efficiently identify the most salient temporal clips within a long video. We demonstrate that the computational cost of action recognition on untrimmed videos can be dramatically reduced by invoking recognition only on these most salient clips.

The multi-scale context module refers to the operations to aggregate feature responses from a large spatial extent, while the single-stage encoder-decoder structure encodes the high-level semantic information in the encoder path and recovers the boundary information in the decoder path. In contrast, multi-stage encoder-decoder networks have been widely used in human pose estimation and show superior performance than their single-stage counterpart. However, few efforts have been attempted to bring this effective design to semantic segmentation.

Generally, proposal-free methods generate instance-agnostic semantic segmentation labels and instance-aware features to group pixels into different object instances. However, previous methods mostly employ separate modules for these two sub-tasks and require multiple passes for inference. We argue that treating these two sub-tasks separately is suboptimal. In fact, employing multiple separate modules significantly reduces the potential for application. The mutual benefits between the two complementary sub-tasks are also unexplored. To this end, this work proposes a single-shot proposal-free instance segmentation method that requires only one single pass for prediction. Our method is based on a pixel-pair affinity pyramid, which computes the probability that two pixels belong to the same instance in a hierarchical manner. The affinity pyramid can also be jointly learned with the semantic class labeling and achieve mutual benefits.

SceneGraphNet: Neural Message Passing for 3D Indoor Scene Augmentation,"Yang Zhou, Zachary While, Evangelos Kalogerakis",University of Massachusetts Amherst,100.0,usa,0.0,,"In this paper we propose a neural message passing approach to augment an input 3D indoor scene with new objects matching their surroundings.

The evidence is selectively sampled to extract discriminative and complementary features, which significantly enrich the learned representation and guide the network to discover more subtle cues. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that the proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on challenging benchmarks including CUB-200-2011, FGVC-Aircraft, and Stanford Cars."
Selectivity or Invariance: Boundary-Aware Salient Object Detection,"Jinming Su, Jia Li, Yu Zhang, Changqun Xia, Yonghong Tian","Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China; National Engineering Laboratory for Video Technology, School of EE&CS, Peking University; State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology and Systems, SCSE, Beihang University",100.0,china,0.0,,"Typically, a salient object detection (SOD) model faces opposite requirements in processing object interiors and boundaries.

These plausible-looking alternatives to ground-truth can restrict what a regression network learns, causing it to predict depth maps of limited quality. As one prominent example, depth discontinuities around thin structures are often incorrectly estimated by current state-of-the-art methods. Here, we study the problem of ambiguous reprojections in depth-prediction from stereo-based self-supervision, and introduce Depth Hints to alleviate their effects. Depth Hints are complementary depth-suggestions obtained from simple off-the-shelf stereo algorithms. These hints enhance an existing photometric loss function, and are used to guide a network to learn better weights. They require no additional data, and are assumed to be right only sometimes.

As one prominent example, depth discontinuities around thin structures are often incorrectly estimated by current state-of-the-art methods. Here, we study the problem of ambiguous reprojections in depth-prediction from stereo-based self-supervision, and introduce Depth Hints to alleviate their effects. Depth Hints are complementary depth-suggestions obtained from simple off-the-shelf stereo algorithms. These hints enhance an existing photometric loss function, and are used to guide a network to learn better weights. They require no additional data, and are assumed to be right only sometimes. We show that using our Depth Hints gives a substantial boost when training several leading self-supervised-from-stereo models, not just our own. Further, combined with other good practices, we produce state-of-the-art depth predictions on the KITTI benchmark."

Sequence Level Semantics Aggregation for Video Object Detection,"Haiping Wu, Yuntao Chen, Naiyan Wang, Zhaoxiang Zhang",TuSimple; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences; McGill University,100.0,"canada, china, usa",0.0,,"Video objection detection (VID) has been a rising research direction in recent years. A central issue of VID is the appearance degradation of video frames caused by fast motion. This problem is essentially ill-posed for a single frame. Therefore, aggregating features from other frames becomes a natural choice. Existing methods rely heavily on optical flow or recurrent neural networks for feature aggregation. However, these methods emphasize more on the temporally nearby frames. In this work, we argue that aggregating features in the full-sequence level will lead to more discriminative and robust features for video object detection. To achieve this goal, we devise a novel Sequence Level Semantics Aggregation (SELSA) module.

A central issue of VID is the appearance degradation of video frames caused by fast motion. This problem is essentially ill-posed for a single frame. Therefore, aggregating features from other frames becomes a natural choice. Existing methods rely heavily on optical flow or recurrent neural networks for feature aggregation. However, these methods emphasize more on the temporally nearby frames. In this work, we argue that aggregating features in the full-sequence level will lead to more discriminative and robust features for video object detection. To achieve this goal, we devise a novel Sequence Level Semantics Aggregation (SELSA) module.

Similarity-Preserving Knowledge Distillation,"Frederick Tung, Greg Mori","Simon Fraser University, Borealis AI",100.0,canada,0.0,,"Knowledge distillation is a widely applicable technique for training a student neural network under the guidance of a trained teacher network. For example, in neural network compression, a high-capacity teacher is distilled to train a compact student; in privileged learning, a teacher trained with privileged data is distilled to train a student without access to that data. The distillation loss determines how a teacher's knowledge is captured and transferred to the student. In this paper, we propose a new form of knowledge distillation loss that is inspired by the observation that semantically similar inputs tend to elicit similar activation patterns in a trained network.

We have defined two main tasks on this dataset: dense semantic segmentation and multi-class lane-marking prediction. We carry out extensive experiments to evaluate state-of-the-art segmentation methods on SkyScapes. Existing methods struggle to deal with the wide range of classes, object sizes, scales, and fine details present. We therefore propose a novel multi-task model, which incorporates semantic edge detection and is better tuned for feature extraction from a wide range of scales. This model achieves notable improvements over the baselines in region outlines and level of detail on both tasks."

The majority of existing algorithms focus on aggregating multi-level features of pre-trained convolutional neural networks. Moreover, some researchers attempt to utilize edge information for auxiliary training. However, existing edge-aware models design unidirectional frameworks which only use edge features to improve the segmentation features. Motivated by the logical interrelations between binary segmentation and edge maps, we propose a novel Stacked Cross Refinement Network (SCRN) for salient object detection in this paper. Our framework aims to simultaneously refine multi-level features of salient object detection and edge detection by stacking Cross Refinement Unit (CRU). According to the logical interrelations, the CRU designs two direction-specific integration operations, and bidirectionally passes messages between the two tasks. Incorporating the refined edge-preserving features with the typical U-Net, our model detects salient objects accurately.

The majority of existing algorithms focus on aggregating multi-level features of pre-trained convolutional neural networks. Moreover, some researchers attempt to utilize edge information for auxiliary training. However, existing edge-aware models design unidirectional frameworks which only use edge features to improve the segmentation features. Motivated by the logical interrelations between binary segmentation and edge maps, we propose a novel Stacked Cross Refinement Network (SCRN) for salient object detection in this paper. Our framework aims to simultaneously refine multi-level features of salient object detection and edge detection by stacking Cross Refinement Unit (CRU). According to the logical interrelations, the CRU designs two direction-specific integration operations, and bidirectionally passes messages between the two tasks. Incorporating the refined edge-preserving features with the typical U-Net, our model detects salient objects accurately.

Stochastic Exposure Coding for Handling Multi-ToF-Camera Interference,"Jongho Lee, Mohit Gupta",University of Wisconsin-Madison,100.0,usa,0.0,,"As continuous-wave time-of-flight (C-ToF) cameras become popular in 3D imaging applications, they need to contend with the problem of multi-camera interference (MCI).

In this paper, we propose stochastic exposure coding (SEC), a novel approach for mitigating. SEC involves dividing a camera's integration time into multiple slots, and switching the camera off and on stochastically during each slot. This approach has two benefits. First, by appropriately choosing the on probability for each slot, the camera can effectively filter out both the AC and DC components of interfering signals, thereby mitigating depth errors while also maintaining high signal-to-noise ratio. This enables high accuracy depth recovery with low power consumption.

Past shape recovery methods have leveraged various visual cues for estimating shape (e.g., depth) or surface normals. Methods that estimate both compute one from the other. We show that these two geometric surface properties can be simultaneously recovered for each pixel when the object is observed underwater. Our key idea is to leverage multi-wavelength near-infrared light absorption along different underwater light paths in conjunction with surface shading. We derive a principled theory for this surface normals and shape from water method and a practical calibration method for determining its imaging parameters values. By construction, the method can be implemented as a one-shot imaging system.

Past shape recovery methods have leveraged various visual cues for estimating shape (e.g., depth) or surface normals. Methods that estimate both compute one from the other. We show that these two geometric surface properties can be simultaneously recovered for each pixel when the object is observed underwater. Our key idea is to leverage multi-wavelength near-infrared light absorption along different underwater light paths in conjunction with surface shading. Our method can handle both Lambertian and non-Lambertian surfaces. We derive a principled theory for this surface normals and shape from water method and a practical calibration method for determining its imaging parameters values. By construction, the method can be implemented as a one-shot imaging system.

TRB not only preserves the flexibility of skeleton keypoint representation, but also contains rich pose and human shape information. Therefore, it promises broader application areas, such as human shape editing and conditional image generation. We further introduce the challenging problem of TRB estimation, where joint learning of human pose and shape is required. We construct several large-scale TRB estimation datasets, based on the popular 2D pose datasets LSP, MPII and COCO. To effectively solve TRB estimation, we propose a two-branch network (TRB-net) with three novel techniques, namely X-structure (Xs), Directional Convolution (DC) and Pairwise mapping (PM), to enforce multi-level message passing for joint feature learning. We evaluate our proposed TRB-net and several leading approaches on our proposed TRB datasets, and demonstrate the superiority of our method through extensive evaluations."

Texture Fields: Learning Texture Representations in Function Space,"Michael Oechsle, Lars Mescheder, Michael Niemeyer, Thilo Strauss, Andreas Geiger","ETAS GmbH, Bosch Group, Stuttgart; Autonomous Vision Group, MPI for Intelligent Systems and University of T√ºbingen",100.0,germany,0.0,,"In recent years, substantial progress has been achieved in learning-based reconstruction of 3D objects. At the same time, generative models were proposed that can generate highly realistic images. However, despite this success in these closely related tasks, texture reconstruction of 3D objects has received little attention from the research community and state-of-the-art methods are either limited to comparably low resolution or constrained experimental setups. A major reason for these limitations is that common representations of texture are inefficient or hard to interface for modern deep learning techniques. In this paper, we propose Texture Fields, a novel texture representation which is based on regressing a continuous 3D function parameterized with a neural network. Our approach circumvents limiting factors like shape discretization and parameterization, as the proposed texture representation is independent of the shape representation of the 3D object.

However, despite this success in these closely related tasks, texture reconstruction of 3D objects has received little attention from the research community and state-of-the-art methods are either limited to comparably low resolution or constrained experimental setups. A major reason for these limitations is that common representations of texture are inefficient or hard to interface for modern deep learning techniques. In this paper, we propose Texture Fields, a novel texture representation which is based on regressing a continuous 3D function parameterized with a neural network. Our approach circumvents limiting factors like shape discretization and parameterization, as the proposed texture representation is independent of the shape representation of the 3D object.

TexturePose: Supervising Human Mesh Estimation With Texture Consistency,"Georgios Pavlakos, Nikos Kolotouros, Kostas Daniilidis",University of Pennsylvania,100.0,usa,0.0,,"This work addresses the problem of model-based human pose estimation. Recent approaches have made significant progress towards regressing the parameters of parametric human body models directly from images. Because of the absence of images with 3D shape ground truth, relevant approaches rely on 2D annotations or sophisticated architecture designs. In this work, we advocate that there are more cues we can leverage, which are available for free in natural images, i.e., without getting more annotations, or modifying the network architecture. We propose a natural form of supervision, that capitalizes on the appearance constancy of a person among different frames (or viewpoints). This seemingly insignificant and often overlooked cue goes a long way for model-based pose estimation. The parametric model we employ allows us to compute a texture map for each frame. Assuming that the texture of the person does not change dramatically between frames, we can apply a novel texture consistency loss, which enforces that each point in the texture map has the same texture value across all frames. Since the texture is transferred in this common texture map space, no camera motion computation is necessary, or even an assumption of smoothness among frames. This makes our proposed supervision applicable in a variety of settings, ranging from monocular video, to multi-view images. We benchmark our approach against strong baselines that require the same or even more annotations that we do and we consistently outperform them.

"Three-D Safari: Learning to Estimate Zebra Pose, Shape, and Texture From Images √¢¬Ä¬úIn the Wild√¢¬Ä¬ù","Silvia Zuffi, Angjoo Kanazawa, Tanya Berger-Wolf, Michael J. Black","Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, T√ºbingen, Germany; IMATI-CNR, Milan, Italy; University of California, Berkeley; University of Illinois at Chicago",75.0,"Germany, germany, usa",25.0,Italy,"We present the first method to perform automatic 3D pose, shape and texture capture of animals from images acquired in-the-wild. In particular, we focus on the problem of capturing 3D information about Grevy's zebras from a collection of images. The Grevy's zebra is one of the most endangered species in Africa, with only a few thousand individuals left. Capturing the shape and pose of these animals can provide biologists and conservationists with information about animal health and behavior. In contrast to research on human pose, shape and texture estimation, training data for endangered species is limited, the animals are in complex natural scenes with occlusion, they are naturally camouflaged, travel in herds, and look similar to each other. To overcome these challenges, we integrate the recent SMAL animal model into a network-based regression pipeline, which we train end-to-end on synthetically generated images with pose, shape, and background variation. Going beyond state-of-the-art methods for human shape and pose estimation, our method learns a shape space for zebras during training. Learning such a shape space from images using only a photometric loss is novel, and the approach can be used to learn shape in other settings with limited 3D supervision. Moreover, we couple 3D pose and shape prediction with the task of texture synthesis, obtaining a full texture map of the animal from a single image. We show that the predicted texture map allows a novel per-instance unsupervised optimization over the network features. This method, SMALST (SMAL with learned Shape and Texture) goes beyond previous work, which assumed manual keypoints and/or segmentation, to regress directly from pixels to 3D animal shape, pose and texture.",,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Zuffi_Three-D_Safari_Learning_to_Estimate_Zebra_Pose_Shape_and_Texture_ICCV_2019_paper.html,http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/papers/Zuffi_Three-D_Safari_Learning_to_Estimate_Zebra_Pose_Shape_and_Texture_ICCV_2019_paper.pdf,,https://github.com/silviazuffi/smalst,,main,Poster,,,,,,

Towards Precise End-to-End Weakly Supervised Object Detection Network,"Ke Yang, Dongsheng Li, Yong Dou",National University of Defense Technology,100.0,China,0.0,,"It is challenging for weakly supervised object detection network to precisely predict the positions of the objects, since there are no instance-level category annotations. Most existing methods tend to solve this problem by using a two-phase learning procedure, i.e., multiple instance learning detector followed by a fully supervised learning detector with bounding-box regression. Based on our observation, this procedure may lead to local minima for some object categories. In this paper, we propose to jointly train the two phases in an end-to-end manner to tackle this problem.

In the sequence alignment task, the model determines whether an instruction corresponds to a sequence of visual frames. In the sequence coherence task, the model determines whether the perceptual sequences are predictive sequentially in the instruction-conditioned latent space. By transferring the domain-adapted representations, we improve competitive agents in R2R as measured by the success rate weighted by path length (SPL) metric."

Quantitative and human-perception experiments with two diverse datasets demonstrate the advantage of our UFO search solution over related baselines."
Unconstrained Motion Deblurring for Dual-Lens Cameras,"M. R. Mahesh Mohan, Sharath Girish, A. N. Rajagopalan",Indian Institute of Technology Madras,100.0,"India, india",0.0,,"Recently, there has been a renewed interest in leveraging multiple cameras, but under unconstrained settings.

Unpaired Image-to-Speech Synthesis With Multimodal Information Bottleneck,"Shuang Ma, Daniel McDuff, Yale Song","SUNY Buffalo, Buffalo, NY; Microsoft, Redmond, WA",0.0,,100.0,USA,"Deep generative models have led to significant advances in cross-modal generation such as text-to-image synthesis. Training these models typically requires paired data with direct correspondence between modalities. We introduce the novel problem of translating instances from one modality to another without paired data by leveraging an intermediate modality shared by the two other modalities. To demonstrate this, we take the problem of translating images to speech. In this case, one could leverage disjoint datasets with one shared modality, e.g., image-text pairs and text-speech pairs, with text as the shared modality. We call this problem ""skip-modal generation"" because the shared modality is skipped during the generation process. We propose a multimodal information bottleneck approach that learns the correspondence between modalities from unpaired data (image and speech) by leveraging the shared modality (text). We address fundamental challenges of skip-modal generation: 1) learning multimodal representations using a single model, 2) bridging the domain gap between two unrelated datasets, and 3) learning the correspondence between modalities from unpaired data. We show qualitative results on image-to-speech synthesis; this is the first time such results have been reported in the literature.

In this case, one could leverage disjoint datasets with one shared modality, e.g., image-text pairs and text-speech pairs, with text as the shared modality. We call this problem ``skip-modal generation'' because the shared modality is skipped during the generation process. We propose a multimodal information bottleneck approach that learns the correspondence between modalities from unpaired data (image and speech) by leveraging the shared modality (text). We address fundamental challenges of skip-modal generation: 1) learning multimodal representations using a single model, 2) bridging the domain gap between two unrelated datasets, and 3) learning the correspondence between modalities from unpaired data. We show qualitative results on image-to-speech synthesis; this is the first time such results have been reported in the literature. We also show that our approach improves performance on traditional cross-modal generation, suggesting that it improves data efficiency in solving individual tasks."

Unsupervised Out-of-Distribution Detection by Maximum Classifier Discrepancy,"Qing Yu, Kiyoharu Aizawa","The University of Tokyo, Japan",100.0,Japan,0.0,,"Since deep learning models have been implemented in many commercial applications, it is important to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs correctly to maintain the performance of the models, ensure the quality of the collected data, and prevent the applications from being used for other-than-intended purposes.

Among the captions, there are over 206,000 English-Chinese parallel translation pairs. Compared to the widely-used MSR-VTT dataset, \vatex is multilingual, larger, linguistically complex, and more diverse in terms of both video and natural language descriptions. We also introduce two tasks for video-and-language research based on \vatex: (1) Multilingual Video Captioning, aimed at describing a video in various languages with a compact unified captioning model, and (2) Video-guided Machine Translation, to translate a source language description into the target language using the video information as additional spatiotemporal context.

Compared to the widely-used MSRVTT dataset [64], VATEX is multilingual, larger, linguistically complex, and more diverse in terms of both video and natural language descriptions. We also introduce two tasks for video-and-language research based on VATEX: (1) Multilingual Video Captioning, aimed at describing a video in various languages with a compact unified captioning model, and (2) Video-guided Machine Translation, to translate a source language description into the target language using the video information as additional spatiotemporal context.

Video Classification With Channel-Separated Convolutional Networks,"Du Tran, Heng Wang, Lorenzo Torresani, Matt Feiszli",Facebook AI,0.0,,100.0,USA,"Group convolution has been shown to offer great computational savings in various 2D convolutional architectures for image classification. It is natural to ask: 1) if group convolution can help to alleviate the high computational cost of video classification networks; 2) what factors matter the most in 3D group convolutional networks; and 3) what are good computation/accuracy trade-offs with 3D group convolutional networks. This paper studies the effects of different design choices in 3D group convolutional networks for video classification. We empirically demonstrate that the amount of channel interactions plays an important role in the accuracy of 3D group convolutional networks. Our experiments suggest two main findings. First, it is a good practice to factorize 3D convolutions by separating channel interactions and spatiotemporal interactions as this leads to improved accuracy and lower computational cost.

It is natural to ask: 1) if group convolution can help to alleviate the high computational cost of video classification networks; 2) what factors matter the most in 3D group convolutional networks; and 3) what are good computation/accuracy trade-offs with 3D group convolutional networks. This paper studies the effects of different design choices in 3D group convolutional networks for video classification. We empirically demonstrate that the amount of channel interactions plays an important role in the accuracy of 3D group convolutional networks. Our experiments suggest two main findings. First, it is a good practice to factorize 3D convolutions by separating channel interactions and spatiotemporal interactions as this leads to improved accuracy and lower computational cost. Second, 3D channel-separated convolutions provide a form of regularization, yielding lower training accuracy but higher test accuracy compared to 3D convolutions.

Weakly Supervised Temporal Action Localization Through Contrast Based Evaluation Networks,"Ziyi Liu, Le Wang, Qilin Zhang, Zhanning Gao, Zhenxing Niu, Nanning Zheng, Gang Hua","HERE Technologies; Institute of ArtiÔ¨Åcial Intelligence and Robotics, Xi‚Äôan Jiaotong University; DAMO Academy, Alibaba Group; Machine Intelligence Israel Lab, Alibaba Group; Wormpex AI Research",40.0,china,60.0,Netherlands,"Weakly-supervised temporal action localization (WS-TAL) is a promising but challenging task with only video-level action categorical labels available during training. Without requiring temporal action boundary annotations in training data, WS-TAL could possibly exploit automatically retrieved video tags as video-level labels. However, such coarse video-level supervision inevitably incurs confusions, especially in untrimmed videos containing multiple action instances. To address this challenge, we propose the Contrast-based Localization EvaluAtioN Network (CleanNet) with our new action proposal evaluator, which provides pseudo-supervision by leveraging the temporal contrast in snippet-level action classification predictions. Essentially, the new action proposal evaluator enforces an additional temporal contrast constraint so that high-evaluation-score action proposals are more likely to coincide with true action instances. Moreover, the new action localization module is an integral part of CleanNet which enables end-to-end training.

However, the coarse video-level supervision inevitably incurs ambiguities in action localization, especially in untrimmed videos containing multiple action instances.

This motivates us to introduce a Contrast-based Localization EvaluAtioN Network (CleanNet), whose core is a new temporal action proposal evaluator, which provides fine-grained pseudo supervision by leveraging the temporal contrasts among snippet-level classification predictions.

What Synthesis Is Missing: Depth Adaptation Integrated With Weak Supervision for Indoor Scene Parsing,"Keng-Chi Liu, Yi-Ting Shen, Jan P.

Supervised deep learning methods have made great progress in solving scene parsing problems, however, come at the cost of laborious manual pixel-level annotation.

Nonetheless, synthetically generated data still suffers from severe domain shift while weak labels often lack precision.

Zero-Shot Grounding of Objects From Natural Language Queries,"Arka Sadhu, Kan Chen, Ram Nevatia",Facebook Inc.; University of Southern California,50.0,usa,50.0,USA,"A phrase grounding system localizes a particular object in an image referred to by a natural language query. In previous work, the phrases were restricted to have nouns that were encountered in training, we extend the task to Zero-Shot Grounding(ZSG) which can include novel, ""unseen"" nouns. Current phrase grounding systems use an explicit object detection network in a 2-stage framework where one stage generates sparse proposals and the other stage evaluates them. In the ZSG setting, generating appropriate proposals itself becomes an obstacle as the proposal generator is trained on the entities common in the detection and grounding datasets. We propose a new single-stage model called ZSGNet which combines the detector network and the grounding system and predicts classification scores and regression parameters.

Current phrase grounding systems use an explicit object detection network in a 2-stage framework where one stage generates sparse proposals and the other stage evaluates them. In the ZSG setting, generating appropriate proposals itself becomes an obstacle as the proposal generator is trained on the entities common in the detection and grounding datasets. We propose a new single-stage model called ZSGNet which combines the detector network and the grounding system and predicts classification scores and regression parameters.

However, few works have been done and their performance have also been limited. In this work, we present a novel robust and real-time long-term tracking framework based on the proposed skimming and perusal modules. The perusal module consists of an effective bounding box regressor to generate a series of candidate proposals and a robust target verifier to infer the optimal candidate with its confidence score. Based on this score, our tracker determines whether the tracked object being present or absent, and then chooses the tracking strategies of local search or global search respectively in the next frame. To speed up the image-wide global search, a novel skimming module is designed to efficiently choose the most possible regions from a large number of sliding windows. Numerous experimental results on the VOT-2018 long-term and OxUvA long-term benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the best performance and runs in real-time.
